      content:
        '<p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0)">A man’s head reflects his age. Noticing hair loss or a receding hairline can make you feel insecure and induce the desire to hide them. Many people do not know about maturing and receding hairlines. It is important to know the difference between the two, so you be cautious to prevent extreme hair loss. While one is due to normal ageing, another is caused by hair loss.&nbsp;</span></p><p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0)">To know more, keep reading the blog.</span></p><h1><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0)">Why is understanding the maturing hairline important to know?</span></h1><p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0)">In the shift from adolescence into adulthood, you see the visible changes in hair patterns. Just like skin ageing, the hairline moves backwards as you get old. This is where hair follicles thin and recede, but it\'s completely natural.</span></p><p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0)">Your hairline typically moves back by about ½ to 1 inch, providing an M-shaped look. Generally, maturing hairline takes place between the ages of 17-30 years. The change will be very gradual and you will not experience excessive hair shedding or thinning.&nbsp;The Best Sign To Identify a Maturing Hairline is minimal hair loss. If there is no further significant thinning, the hair is likely maturing, not receding.</span></p><h1><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0)">Understanding the concept of receding hairline</span></h1><p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0)">You may have heard the word “male pattern baldness” specifically called “androgenic alopecia”, which causes receding hairline. It shows up when hair follicles shrink due to hormonal fluctuations and genetic factors. This eventually results in permanent hair loss.</span></p><p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0)">It often occurs after the age of 50, but some may experience it earlier. Receding hairline usually takes place faster than maturing and can be significant through noticeable scalp exposure in the crown and temples.</span></p><h2><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0)">Reasons for Receding Hairline</span></h2><ul class="list-disc list-outside leading-3 -mt-2"><li class="leading-normal -mb-2"><p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0)">Hormones: a hormone called “DHT (dihydrotestosterone)” is responsible for the condition called “male pattern baldness”.

      title: "Caffeine Shampoo: Hair Loss Solution No One Told You About",
      content:
        '<p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0)">Everyone loves caffeine. It can be like rejuvenating morning coffee or mid-time energy-boosting intake because caffeine elevates energy levels shortly after having it. Some researchers use caffeine as a solution for hair loss, but the mechanism behind it remains unclear. Depending on an individual\'s hair issues and the cause, its effectiveness varies. Let\'s find out if this caffeine shampoo helps with hair problems and how it works for hair issues in common.</span></p><h2><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0)">What is Caffeine Shampoo?</span></h2><p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0)">Caffeine shampoo is a type of shampoo that contains caffeine as an active ingredient. It contains the extract compound of coffee beans. It is often marketed as a hair care product that aids in hair loss. Some studies say that it helps to stimulate hair growth as it penetrates the scalp.</span></p><h2><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0)">How This Caffeine Shampoo Works</span></h2><h3><span style="color: rgb(67, 67, 67)">Clogging hair loss-causing hormone</span></h3><p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0)">Some studies have shown that using caffeine-based shampoo can block hair loss-causing hormones. You may have heard of DHT (Dihydrotestosterone)—A hormone responsible for conditions like androgenic alopecia (male pattern baldness). Using caffeine shampoo helps manage this condition.</span></p><h3><span style="color: rgb(67, 67, 67)">Facilitates blood circulation</span></h3><p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0)">Caffeine shampoo helps give good blood circulation to the scalp. As it provides essential nutrients and a good level of oxygen for hair growth.</span></p><h3><span style="color: rgb(67, 67, 67)">Extends hair growth phase</span></h3><p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0)">People who lack essential hair nutrients often experience hair loss. Although the hair growth phase lasts briefly, this cycle can be transformed when using caffeine. Caffeine shampoos help to sustain the hair growth phase of the hair cycle for a little longer. This results in a good amount of hair growth.</span></p><h3><span style="color: rgb(67, 67, 67)">Optimizes scalp health</span></h3><p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0)">Caffeine is rich in antioxidants, so this enhances the health of the hair strands and the hair scalp. Also, the anti-inflammatory properties of caffeine help with dandruff and irritation.</span></p><h3><span style="color: rgb(67, 67, 67)">Reinforcing hair and hair roots</span></h3><p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0)">By stimulating the follicles, caffeine makes hair roots stronger. This leads to less breakage of hair.</span></p><h2><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0)">The Potential Benefits of Caffeine Shampoo</span></h2><ul class="list-disc list-outside leading-3 -mt-2"><li class="leading-normal -mb-2"><p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0)">Some studies declared that using caffeine can stimulate hair follicles. As it penetrates into the scalp and helps in hair growth.</span></p></li><li class="leading-normal -mb-2"><p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0)">This caffeine shampoo may help to slow down mild hair thinning. yet, this is not a cure for permanent hair loss.</span></p></li><li class="leading-normal -mb-2"><p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0)">Caffeine shampoos work among people who experience mild to moderate hair thinning. People with advanced baldness won\'t benefit from caffeine shampoo.</span></p></li><li class="leading-normal -mb-2"><p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0)">Additionally, studies show that this caffeine shampoo helps with genetic hair loss. People in the early stages of alopecia might benefit.</span></p></li><li class="leading-normal -mb-2"><p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0)">Individuals seeking drug-free and gentle shampoos can choose caffeine shampoos as an option.</span></p></li></ul><h2><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0)">Shortcomings of Using Caffeine Shampoo</span></h2><h3><span style="color: rgb(67, 67, 67)">Limited absorption:</span></h3><p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0)">It takes time to penetrate the scalp into the hair follicles as many people rinse it off quickly.</span></p><h3><span style="color: rgb(67, 67, 67)">Takes a lot of time:</span></h3><p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0)">&nbsp;You should use it for a significant amount of time to notice any progressive results. And the results differ for each individual.</span></p><h3><span style="color: rgb(67, 67, 67)">Only effective with other treatments:</span></h3><p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0)">unlike other harmful chemicals that act immediately, this has a mild formulation. And this works more when used alongside other methods.</span></p><h3><span style="color: rgb(67, 67, 67)">Can dry out or irritate:</span></h3><p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0)">some might have too sensitive skin. This caffeine shampoo dries out the skin and irritates it.</span></p><h3><span style="color: rgb(67, 67, 67)">Not effective for all hair types:</span></h3><p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0)">This is effective with androgenetic alopecia patients but not with other hair conditions.</span></p><h2><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0)">Final Verdict</span></h2><p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0)">Caffeine shampoo extends the hair loss phase. So, using it for the long term can benefit to a certain extent. Yet, it is not a miracle cure. It works as the best part of an inclusive hair care routine. And it should be combined with other treatments for significant hair loss. Caffeine shampoo alone won\'t fight for hair growth. yet, consuming a nutritional diet helps to tackle the situation.&nbsp;</span></p>',

      title: "How Exercise Improves Hair Growth: Workouts and Their Benefits ",
      content:
        '<p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0)">Everybody loves healthy and voluminous hair, but only some people engage in activities to keep it more nutritious. Our hair needs persistent exercises and activities for better nutrient absorption. This modern age is more intertwined with sedentary lifestyles. Besides, other factors like genetics, hormones, and ageing impact hair health, too. Can regular exercise prevent hair loss and help hair growth? This blog explains.</span></p><h1><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0)">Understanding Hair Fall and the reason behind it</span></h1><p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0)">The biggest challenge with hair fall victims is that they take a lot of time to identify the root cause. Thus, before reviewing how exercise can help, it’s important to understand what causes hair fall so that you know what might be your mistake.</span></p><ul class="list-disc list-outside leading-3 -mt-2"><li class="leading-normal -mb-2"><p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0)"><strong>Genetics:</strong> Hereditary hair loss, or androgenetic alopecia, is the most common form of hair loss.</span></p></li><li class="leading-normal -mb-2"><p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0)"><strong>Hormonal Changes:</strong> Imbalances, including those in cortisol and testosterone, can lead to hair thinning.</span></p></li><li class="leading-normal -mb-2"><p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0)"><strong>Nutritional Deficiencies</strong>: A lack of essential vitamins, proteins, and minerals can weaken hair.</span></p></li><li class="leading-normal -mb-2"><p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0)"><strong>Stress and Lifestyles:</strong> High stress levels and a poor lifestyle, like being inactive, often contribute to hair fall.</span></p></li></ul><p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0)">While some causes, like genetics, are beyond our control, others are influenced by lifestyle choices, including physical activity, nutrition, and stress management.</span></p><h1><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0)">Exercise and Hair Health</span></h1><p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0)">Although exercising is not completely connected with hair growth, regular exercise may support good blood circulation, leading to better hair health. Activities like cycling, cardio, and brisk walking are the most effective ways of improving blood circulation. Scientifically, it claims that regular involvement in activities like cardio exercising will control cortisol levels and influence healthy hair growth.&nbsp;</span></p><h2><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0)">Types of Exercises Beneficial for Hair Health</span></h2><h3><span style="color: rgb(102, 102, 102)">Cardio for Improved Blood Circulation</span></h3><p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0)">Cardio has numerous health benefits for the body by promoting a balanced metabolism. Other exercises like cycling, treadmill walking, jogging, and brisk walking help improve hair health by supplying necessary nutrients with balanced blood circulation.</span></p><p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0)">Especially, Certain individuals assert that engaging in&nbsp; 30-40 minutes of cardio workouts regularly for a week can reduce cortisol levels, positively affecting healthy hair follicles.</span></p><h3><span style="color: rgb(102, 102, 102)">Strength Training and Hormone Regulation</span></h3><p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0)">Another major complaint of hair fall is hormonal imbalance, especially among women facing menopause and men with high testosterone levels. This issue can be alleviated by engaging in 2-3 days of 30-minute resistance band training sessions once a week. This helps manage high cortisol levels and maintain testosterone within normal ranges. Balanced weightlifting and strength training stabilize hormone levels.</span></p><h3><span style="color: rgb(102, 102, 102)">Yoga and Meditation for Hair Growth</span></h3><p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0)">Yoga is an incredible technique for individuals aiming to gain hair growth naturally. Doing yoga and meditation enhances scalp circulation, calms the mind, and decreases cortisol levels.&nbsp;</span></p><p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0)">Giving importance to scalp-stimulating poses and relaxation techniques is often effective and provides fast results. Meditation, along with yoga, handles stress-related hair loss. Engaging in specific yoga poses for 1–2 minutes promotes scalp health.</span></p><h2><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0)">Other key factors to remember</span></h2><p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0)">Exercising barely resolves hair fall as one solution. A balanced diet and proper hydration are also essential for hair health. Consuming a good amount of protein from fish, lean meats, and legumes, and certain vitamin-enriched foods can be helpful for healthy hair growth. Iron and zinc help transport oxygen to hair follicles. Taking well-balanced nutritional food together with exercise does wonders in various ways.</span></p><h2><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0)">Excess workout and its drawbacks</span></h2><p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0)">Overdoing extreme workouts has its dark side, where hair thinning and abnormal hair fall are seen because of cortisol surge. Also, sweat piles onto the scalp over time, a common cause for an oily scalp. To prevent this, wipe out all the sweat and shower your hair properly after every long workout.</span></p><h2><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0)">Success Stories&nbsp;</span></h2><p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0)">Many claim that consistent workouts have shown positive results, especially reflected in the hair. An intriguing lifestyle with a balanced diet has positive effects on hair health. The combination of moderate exercise and balanced nutrition has helped many to optimize their overall health, and this showcases the potential benefits of physical fitness for healthy hair.</span></p><h3><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0)"><strong>FAQs</strong></span></h3><p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0)"><strong>Can excessive exercise cause hair loss?<br></strong>Yes, excessive high-intensity exercise can spike cortisol levels, which may lead to hair shedding. Balance and moderation are key.</span></p><p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0)"><strong>How long does it take to see hair health improvements with exercise?<br></strong>It typically takes 3–6 months of consistent exercise for noticeable hair improvements, though this varies by individual.</span></p><p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0)"><strong>Does weightlifting specifically help in reducing hair fall?<br></strong>Moderate weightlifting can support hormonal balance, which can help reduce hair fall, especially in cases linked to stress and hormone imbalances.</span></p><p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0)"><strong>Are there any exercises that might harm hair health?<br></strong>Overly intense workouts without adequate rest can increase cortisol and potentially harm hair health, so a balanced approach is best.</span></p><p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0)"><strong>How can I combine exercise with other hair growth treatments?<br></strong>Regular exercise pairs well with a healthy diet, proper scalp care, and medical treatments like minoxidil for a comprehensive hair health approach.</span></p><p><br></p>',

      title: "Why does hair thin as we age?",
      content:
        '<p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0)">We notice our bodies change in various ways as we age, and hair is one of them. Ageing is linked to hair loss or hair fall for multiple reasons, such as hormonal shifts, genetics, and health. Generally, the body weakens with age, and this differs from person to person. While some don\'t see visible changes, a few may see them. This blog helps you understand the link between thin hair and the age factor. Let us get into it.</span></p><h2><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0)">Understanding the normal cycle of growth</span></h2><p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0)">Typically, hair growth follows three phases;&nbsp;</span></p><p><span style="color: rgb(102, 102, 102)">Anagen phase ( growth ):</span></p><p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0)">In the growth phase, the hair follicles produce new hair strands, and this period may extend to two to six years, depending on conditions like age, health, and genetics. Hair that stays prolonged in the anagen phase is usually longer, fuller and thicker in younger individuals.</span></p><p><span style="color: rgb(102, 102, 102)">Catagen phase ( transition) :</span></p><p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0)">In the catagen phase, the hair growth slows down, preparing for the resting phase, where hair follicles shrink and this transits to the resting phase. This phase lasts for about two to three weeks.</span></p><p><span style="color: rgb(102, 102, 102)">Telogen phase (Resting and shedding ) :</span></p><p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0)">Hair remains in the resting stage for about two to three months before shedding. Usually, everyone loses between 50-100 hairs per day, but as we age, more hair may enter the telogen phase, contributing to thinning.</span></p><h2><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0)">Contribution of the cycle to thinning</span></h2><p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0)">As we grow older, this cycle changes slowly. The growth phase remains only for a short period, while the other two last for a prolonged time. This extended period of changes visibly shows less voluminous hair and eventually fades in texture. With age, the hair follicles shrink, leading to thin and short hair.&nbsp;</span></p><h2><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0)">The other two factors for thinning&nbsp;</span></h2><h3><span style="color: rgb(67, 67, 67)">1. Genetics</span></h3><p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0)">Genetics plays a vital role in hair thinning as we inherit some of the genes through our ancestors. Early hair thinning is one of the signs of genetic transfer. This lineup comes from both paternal and maternal sides. If any of your family members had hair loss and balding, then you have a huge chance of hair thinning.</span></p><h3><span style="color: rgb(67, 67, 67)">2. Hormonal shifts</span></h3><p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0)">Hormones are another main factor in hair thinning. Our hormonal levels shift gradually over time. For instance, men experience a decline in testosterone and other androgen hormones, which directly influence hair follicles. In women, menopause leads to a decrease in estrogen levels, and thus eventually leads to significant thinning. Additionally, hormone imbalances at any stage in life, such as thyroid disorders, can also accelerate hair thinning.</span></p><h2><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0)">Other Common Health Conditions Linked to Hair Thinning</span></h2><p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0)">Thyroid disorders, autoimmune diseases like alopecia areata, and diabetes are the other common conditions that lead to hair thinning. These conditions affect the overall condition of the body, leading to a decline in the health of the hair strands and scalp.</span></p><h3><span style="color: rgb(67, 67, 67)">Medications and Hair Thinning</span></h3><p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0)">Consuming more medications for prolonged periods has side effects and eventually impacts hair thinning. Certain medications like beta-blockers, antidepressants, and chemotherapy drugs are known for influencing the hair growth cycles. If you suspect any medication is affecting your hair, consult your doctor for possible alternatives.</span></p><h3><span style="color: rgb(67, 67, 67)">Hair Follicle Miniaturisation</span></h3><p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0)">The hair follicles shrink over time, which leads to less voluminous hair, often coming from genetics and age, a common cause of hair thinning in both men and women.</span></p><h3><span style="color: rgb(67, 67, 67)">Hair Thinning Among Genders</span></h3><p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0)">Hair thinning affects men and women differently, primarily due to hormonal variations and genetic predispositions.</span></p><h4><span style="color: rgb(102, 102, 102)">Male Pattern Hair Loss</span></h4><p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0)">Male pattern hair loss, where it visibly takes place, is in the crown area of the head, and this is known as androgenic alopecia, which is typically characterised by a diminishing of the hairline. It’s often driven by genetics and testosterone levels, leading to miniaturised follicles over time.</span></p><h4><span style="color: rgb(102, 102, 102)">Female Pattern Hair Loss</span></h4><p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0)">After attaining a certain stage, usually after menopause, women often experience more thinning of hair across the scalp rather than specific bald spots. This type of hair thinning happens when estrogen levels drop, making hair more susceptible to thinning.</span></p><h2><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0)">Signs of Ageing Hair Beyond Thinning</span></h2><p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0)">Apart from thinning, ageing also brings changes in texture, colour, and elasticity. Many people notice that their hair becomes drier, more brittle, and prone to breakage as they age. Hair greying, while natural, also indicates a reduction in melanin production, which can affect hair quality.</span></p><h3><span style="color: rgb(67, 67, 67)">Preventive Measures to Slow Hair Thinning</span></h3><p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0)">1. Healthy Diet</span></p><p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0)">2. Stress Management</span></p><p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0)">3. Treatments for Age-Related Hair Thinning</span></p><p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0)">4. Topical Treatments</span></p><p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0)">5. Oral medications</span></p><p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0)">6. Hair transplant</span></p><h3><span style="color: rgb(67, 67, 67)">Embracing Healthy Hair as We Age</span></h3><p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0)">Hair thinning is a natural part of ageing, but with the right care and attention, it’s possible to maintain healthier hair for longer. By understanding the factors that contribute to thinning and taking proactive steps, you can support your hair through every stage of life.</span></p><p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0)">We are actively writing hair care and skin care blogs. Check out our previous works that serve your specific issue. Take our health test assessment to identify your stage of the problem and get doctor’s recommendations for free. Your health is our concern.</span></p><h2><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0)">FAQs</span></h2><ol class="list-decimal list-outside leading-3 -mt-2"><li class="leading-normal -mb-2"><p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0)"><strong>Can hair thinning be reversed?</strong></span></p></li></ol><p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0)">Hair thinning can often be slowed or managed, especially with early treatment, but full reversal is rare without specific interventions like medications or surgery.</span></p><ol class="list-decimal list-outside leading-3 -mt-2" start="2"><li class="leading-normal -mb-2"><p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0)"><strong>Does diet affect hair thickness?</strong></span></p></li></ol><p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0)">Yes, diet plays a significant role. Nutrient deficiencies, particularly in iron and vitamins like biotin, can accelerate thinning.</span></p><ol class="list-decimal list-outside leading-3 -mt-2" start="3"><li class="leading-normal -mb-2"><p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0)"><strong>Are natural remedies effective for hair thinning?</strong></span></p></li></ol><p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0)">Natural remedies, like certain oils and scalp massages, can support scalp health and potentially improve growth in minor cases, but they are not a guaranteed solution for severe thinning.</span></p><ol class="list-decimal list-outside leading-3 -mt-2" start="4"><li class="leading-normal -mb-2"><p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0)"><strong>Is stress a major cause of hair thinning?</strong></span></p></li></ol><p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0)">Chronic stress can lead to hair shedding, but it’s usually reversible once stress levels are managed. Long-term stress, however, may have a lasting impact.</span></p><ol class="list-decimal list-outside leading-3 -mt-2" start="5"><li class="leading-normal -mb-2"><p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0)"><strong>How soon should I seek help if I notice hair thinning?</strong></span></p></li></ol><p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0)">It’s best to consult a professional as soon as you notice significant thinning, as early intervention can prevent further loss and provide more options for regrowth.</span><br></p>',

        "Remove Pimples Quickly and Naturally: Easy and Simple Home Remedies",
      content:
        '<p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0)">You are here because of the constant pimple popping out of nowhere. It can be from your face, body, or hairy parts. The worst part is the pain, discomfort, and irritation it causes. Many of us face similar problems and wish they did not occur in the first place, or find a magic formula to hide them.</span></p><p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0)">This common complaint among youngsters can be due to several reasons, such as inadequate lifestyle, hormonal imbalance, overactive sebaceous glands, stress, lack of sleep, and so on.</span></p><p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0)">You don\'t have to worry anymore because we have your back. Studies say that almost 80% of pimples are naturally treatable, so with natural remedies you can reverse your dotted face to clearer and more prominent skin in just a couple of weeks.</span></p><h2><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0)">Chemical Vs. Natural Treatment</span></h2><p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0)">People vary when it comes to choosing the kind of treatment for hair. You might be taking chemical treatment over a natural way or might prefer vice versa. Inorganic treatment might come along with side effects but it provides a temporary and works much faster than natural remedies.&nbsp;</span></p><p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0)">Whereas natural ingredients for pimples might take some time to show results that last but you can stay free from fear of side effects. Although both have pros and cons, it is you who has to choose which works best for you.</span></p><h2><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0)">Natural Home Remedies For Pimples&nbsp;</span></h2><h3><span style="color: rgb(67, 67, 67)">1. Aloe vera gel</span></h3><p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0)">Aloe vera has natural healing properties that soothe the skin and heal breakouts. Applying fresh aloe vera gel directly on pimples and leaving it for 20-30 minutes will help shrink your pimple.</span></p><h3><span style="color: rgb(67, 67, 67)">2. Honey&nbsp;</span></h3><p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0)">Honey has antibacterial properties and works best with cinnamon which has anti-inflammatory properties. Mixing one spoon of honey and a pinch of cinnamon powder directly on the pimple for 15-20 minutes helps get rid of acne.</span></p><h3><span style="color: rgb(102, 102, 102)">3. Apple cider vinegar</span></h3><p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0)">Apple cider vinegar works in a way that it can quickly dry out the pimples and it helps the skin to maintain PH. Dilute ACV with a 1:3 ratio of water, apply over the pimples, leave it for 5 mins, and then rinse it.</span></p><h3><span style="color: rgb(102, 102, 102)">4. Lemon juice</span></h3><p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0)">Lemon contains natural acid. This works similarly to ACV and helps the pimple dry out fast. All you have to do is squeeze some lemon juice and apply it directly on the pimples and let it dry for 10-15 mins then rinse with warm water. Repeating thrice a week can visibly bring changes.</span></p><h3><span style="color: rgb(67, 67, 67)">5. Ice cubes&nbsp;</span></h3><p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0)">Keeping an ice cube and rolling all over the pimples helps to reduce redness, inflammation, and swelling. Repeating 2-3 times a week relieves the pain.</span></p><h3><span style="color: rgb(67, 67, 67)">6. Turmeric paste&nbsp;</span></h3><p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0)">Turmeric has a compound called curcumin that helps in relieving inflammation and redness. It acts as both an anti-inflammatory and antioxidant, so it brings significant results.

      title: "Understanding Androgenetic Alopecia: What to Know",
      content:
        '<p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0)">If you find a flock of hair in your bathroom, kitchen or elsewhere recently, you might have androgenetic alopecia. Though the term may sound a little complex, the underlying concept is simple—permanent hair loss. After knowing the difference between hair fall and hair loss, you might have an idea of what androgenetic alopecia is. If not, do not worry, you can still know about it in this blog which serves you in identifying whether you have it or not. Without any delay, let us get into it.</span></p><h2><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0)">Androgenetic alopecia: a lasting nightmare</span></h2><p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0)">Almost every man after his 30s complains about getting bald and some even do quite early. Though their severity may differ, the problem is common—Androgenetic alopecia. Popularly called male pattern baldness, this culprit haunts many men after a specific age and the cause differs from person to person. Although it begins with mild hair loss, it intensifies with time leading to permanent hair loss, the stage of no hair regain.</span></p><h2><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0)">Causes of Androgenetic Alopecia</span></h2><p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0)">When various study claims several hypotheses, scientists have confirmed two evident reasons for androgenetic alopecia which are the causes in most cases. Genetics play a major role in getting androgenetic alopecia and hormones on the other hand have an equal play over it.&nbsp;</span></p><h3><span style="color: rgb(67, 67, 67)">Genetics: The DNA copies</span></h3><p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0)">Some family lines have early balding particularly men in the ancestors. Your father and grandfather from both family sides might have early hair loss, and this could be your suspicion of hair fall. It happens because of genetic transfer from one generation to the next. You could be the succeeding source of androgenetic alopecia to your son. Although it is disappointing and inevitable, the condition can be managed with a few changes and treatments.</span></p><h3><span style="color: rgb(67, 67, 67)">Hormones: The androgen grooves</span></h3><p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0)">Dihydrotestosterone or DHT, a derivative of testosterone (i.e., male hormone) is responsible for healthy hair growth and its sustainability with age. The low performance of dihydrotestosterone affects susceptible individuals by causing hair follicles to shrink. Over time, this results in thinner, shorter hair strands and eventually halts hair growth.</span></p><p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0)">The reason why Androgenetic alopecia begins in the 30s is due to the decline of testosterone during that period. Teenage boys and just-married men are likely to show a high level of testosterone and thus the impact on hair.</span></p><h2><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0)">Symptoms of Androgenetic Alopecia</span></h2><p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0)">The symptoms of androgenetic alopecia vary among individuals. Some of the symptoms people shown are;</span></p><h3><span style="color: rgb(67, 67, 67)">Receding Hairline</span></h3><p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0)">Androgenetic alopecia often starts with mild receding at the temples, forming an “M” shape. The M void increases with time, leading to severe hair receding, popularly called advanced side receding.</span></p><h3><span style="color: rgb(67, 67, 67)">Thinning at the crown</span></h3><p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0)">Simultaneously, Hair loss begins at the top of the head, often creating a bald spot that expands over time. You might have seen this among aged persons and not often with young men.&nbsp;</span></p><h3><span style="color: rgb(67, 67, 67)">Progressive Hair loss</span></h3><p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0)">Hair continues to thin in the affected areas, eventually leading to partial or complete baldness on the top of the head, while the sides and back usually retain hair.</span></p><h2><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0)">Stages of Androgenetic Alopecia Hair Loss</span></h2><p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0)">For male pattern baldness/ androgenetic alopecia, we usually measure the stage with the Norwood scale. It has seven levels of severity.&nbsp;</span></p><p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0)">In the first stage, men find minimal or hair hairline recession and then slight recession at the temples forming a “V” shape at the front. The third level intense with the deepening recession at the temples, is usually considered the onset of significant hair loss.</span></p><p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0)">More severe hair loss at the crown is seen in the fourth stage. Followed by, hair loss at the crown and frontal begins to merge, creating a “U” shape around the sides. In stage 6, hair loss at the crown and front becomes more extensive with minimal hair connecting the sides.</span></p><p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0)">In the most advanced stage, there would only be a band of hair around the sides and back of the head. And in this level, the chances of retaining hair are difficult or impossible. The only way to cover it is through an external prosthetic like a wig.</span></p><h2><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0)">Time to consult a doctor</span></h2><p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0)">It is a good idea to consult a doctor about androgenetic alopecia when you notice any of the following:</span></p><ol class="list-decimal list-outside leading-3 -mt-2"><li class="leading-normal -mb-2"><p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0)">Sudden or rapid hair loss</span></p></li><li class="leading-normal -mb-2"><p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0)">Bald spots or patches</span></p></li><li class="leading-normal -mb-2"><p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0)">Hair loss at an early age</span></p></li><li class="leading-normal -mb-2"><p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0)">Emotional or psychological distress</span></p></li><li class="leading-normal -mb-2"><p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0)">Scalp pain, itching, or inflammation</span></p></li><li class="leading-normal -mb-2"><p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0)">Interest in treatments or preventative measures</span></p></li></ol><h2><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0)">Home treatment for Androgenetic alopecia</span></h2><p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0)">Taking home treatment for androgenetic alopecia is the least effective however, these tips might help recover you in the beginner or intermediate stage.</span></p><h3><span style="color: rgb(67, 67, 67)">Scalp massage</span></h3><p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0)">Blood circulation is essential for regulating continuous hair growth. If you are not an active or workaholic, you might need scalp massage regularly. Not only does it control hair loss but also reduces stress which later induces cortisol, a hormone that pulls off hair loss.</span></p><h3><span style="color: rgb(67, 67, 67)">Essential oils</span></h3><p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0)">There are several essential oils available in the market and you just have to choose one of your own choice. Although every essential oil contributes to hair growth, some of them like rosemary, almond oil, bhrigaraj, and onion oil have been rigorous hair inducers through the ages. Check for 100% purity labels as some brands could pretend to be genuine despite not being. Another tip to remember before buying is to look for oil in a dark glass bottle or transfer the oil into some glass dim in colour as it could help protect the oil’s quality.</span></p><h3><span style="color: rgb(67, 67, 67)">Aloe vera</span></h3><p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0)">Aloe vera is indeed a great option for people with dry and frizzy hair. Even if you do not have dense hair at all, using aloe vera in your hair care will give a look of having shiny and thick hair. It has immense hydrating properties that will quench the thirst of your barren strands.&nbsp;</span></p><h3><span style="color: rgb(67, 67, 67)">Onion juice</span></h3><p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0)">Being a universal hair problem solution, onion juice solves almost every hair complaint. Its anti-microbial properties help to prevent dandruff or quell dandruff permanently. Various reports claim evidence of incoming baby hair after using onion in any form. You could either buy onion-based products or DIY onion juice at home, a penny-wise option. Making onion juice is very simple yet effective. Just take 5-6 small onions (preferable). Paste it and strain the juice. Mix it with oil for sensitive scalps or use it directly for others.</span></p><h3><span style="color: rgb(67, 67, 67)">Green tea&nbsp;</span></h3><p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0)">Dieticians suggest their clients intake green tea to cut their weight, especially overweight individuals in fast kg reduction. Apart from being an effective slim downer, green tea also impacts largely hair growth areas. The epigallocatechin gallate (EGCG) in green tea prevents hair loss by inhibiting the activity of hormones that induce hair loss and promoting hair regrowth by stimulating hair follicles.</span></p><h3><span style="color: rgb(67, 67, 67)">Healthy diet and hydration</span></h3><p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0)">To stay healthy and keep track of hydrating oneself is not a new piece of advice you might be hearing for the first time. Though it is an old saying, the role it plays in getting luscious hair and smoother skin is impressive. Almost half your body including hair is made of water. Thus, drinking 3 to 4 liters of water is essential. At the same time, the nutrients you take must be in a balanced proportion of fibers, carbohydrates and proteins, again which helps build hair and muscles. A good diet will aid in constructing healthy hair strands while water is for better nutrient absorption.</span></p>',

The brands are trustworthy and clinically tested. This assessment and recommendation is free of cost.&nbsp;</span></p><h2><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0)">Men\'s Hormonal level</span></h2><p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0)">Hormonal imbalances in men can range from a low level of imbalance to a high level. These variations are due to factors that include age, environment, lifestyle, emotional state, and medical conditions. If you’re asking yourself “Can hormone imbalance cause hair loss?” the answer is yes!</span></p><h3><span style="color: rgb(67, 67, 67)">Andropause</span></h3><p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0)">After 30s, every other man undergoes andropause, a male version of menopause. Men endure hormonal imbalances parallel to women that inflict on emotions, mood, biological processes and activities. Although these inevitabilities are normal, men could be more safe with effective therapies.</span></p><p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0)">Testosterone, the prime male hormone, declines while ageing. This has a direct link to hair loss on the scalp and hair growth in places such as the ears and nose. Lab tests are performed to assess the hormonal balance of the patient and determine if the imbalance is at low or high levels. </span></p><p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0)">Treatments such as Bioidentical Hormone Replacement Therapy (BHRT) is a way to correct the imbalance and provide male patients with overall well-being, additionally helping restore hair growth to a healthy pattern.

For instance, a scarce amount of protein can inhibit a normal healthy growth cycle. Less nutritious foods from plants can cause a lack of vitamins and minerals that contribute to hormonal malfunction. Additionally, soy-based products, alcohol and processed foods are most likely to decrease testosterone levels.</span></p><p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0)">Smoking and lack of sleep also play a role in pro-generating healthy hormones. Emotional troubles such as long-term depression, anxiety or any mental disorders disrupt your endocrine (hormone-inducing) system.</span></p><h3><span style="color: rgb(67, 67, 67)">Medical Conditions</span></h3><p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0)">Certain medications that treat medical or mental conditions also affect the hormonal balance of a person, antidepressants are one example. Diseases such as cancer, gout, high blood pressure, arthritis, and others can contribute to an imbalance in hormones that can lead to hair loss. The hair loss may be temporary as the condition improves, or it could leave permanent damage if left untreated for too long.</span></p><h2><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0)">Symptoms of hormonal imbalance</span></h2><p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0)">Hormones are chemical messengers that tell tissues and organs how to function.

Maintaining regulation in the following aspects will streamline the hormones.</span></p><h3><span style="color: rgb(67, 67, 67)">Healthy Diet</span></h3><p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0)">Taking adequate amounts of proteins, carbohydrates, fibres and fats is essential for overall health, including hair. Simply cutting down the meals dilutes the body’s health. Under-diet people can take low-calorie foods in split meals instead of cutting foods that may drain their energy and affect the regulatory system.</span></p><h3><span style="color: rgb(67, 67, 67)">Sleep</span></h3><p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0)">Most testosterone is produced during deep sleep, so getting enough sleep is important. Less than eight hours of sleep can reduce testosterone levels by up to 15%.&nbsp;</span></p><h3><span style="color: rgb(67, 67, 67)">Exercise</span></h3><p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0)">A combination of aerobic and resistance training can increase testosterone production. Maintaining an ideal body weight can help maintain normal testosterone levels. Losing even 15 to 20 pounds can make a difference.&nbsp;</span></p><h3><span style="color: rgb(67, 67, 67)">Alcohol</span></h3><p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0)">Excessive alcohol consumption can lower testosterone levels. Heavy drinking is usually considered more than 15 drinks a week for men.&nbsp;</span></p><h3><span style="color: rgb(67, 67, 67)">Smoking</span></h3><p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0)">Apart from these shifts, smoking also affects testosterone levels studies claim. It is better to put a stop to the use of cigarettes for the betterment.</span></p><p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0)">Along with making lifestyle changes, hormone therapy for hair loss may be suggested in your case to control the body’s DHT levels. Typically, sufferers of hair loss will be prescribed oral medications such as the popular 5-alpha-reductase inhibitor, Finasteride. Better consult a doctor to figure out the right cause and follow the medications under supervision.</span></p><p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0)">We are actively writing hair care and skin care blogs.

      content:
        '<p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0)">Having dense and thick hair enhances one\'s attractiveness and significantly contributes to a pleasing appearance. It\'s ok to lose some amount of hair daily that gets replaced by new hair growth. But when you shed more than normal, you should definitely focus on your hair and scalp health. Healthy hair looks more vibrant and boosts your overall confidence. However, it can be quite disappointing to observe more hair strands on your pillow or in the shower drain. Let\'s see what causes the hair to shed more and how our daily habits of hair care connect with it.</span></p><h2><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0)">What Is Normal Hair Fall?</span></h2><p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0)">The biggest surprise is that, on average, a person can lose up to 100 hair strands a day. Naturally, the hair goes through a cycle of growth, rest, shedding, and growth, and this loop continues. But first, it\'s important to understand the difference between normal shedding and significant shedding. When you notice more hair in your quilt, brush, pillow, and shower, or if your hair is visibly thinning, it could be a sign of excessive hair loss that needs attention.&nbsp;</span></p><h2><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0)">Various Factors of Hair Fall</span></h2><p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0)">There are so many common factors that contribute to hair fall, including&nbsp;</span></p><ul class="list-disc list-outside leading-3 -mt-2"><li class="leading-normal -mb-2"><p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0)">Genetics</span></p></li><li class="leading-normal -mb-2"><p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0)">Hormonal imbalance</span></p></li><li class="leading-normal -mb-2"><p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0)">Stress</span></p></li><li class="leading-normal -mb-2"><p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0)">nutritional deficiencies</span></p></li><li class="leading-normal -mb-2"><p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0)">Hairstyling habits</span></p></li><li class="leading-normal -mb-2"><p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0)">Medical conditions&nbsp;</span></p></li><li class="leading-normal -mb-2"><p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0)">Medications</span></p></li><li class="leading-normal -mb-2"><p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0)">Pregnancy</span></p></li><li class="leading-normal -mb-2"><p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0)">Skipping meals</span></p></li><li class="leading-normal -mb-2"><p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0)">Irregular hair washing</span></p></li></ul><p></p><p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0)">However, the most important and developing cause is the genetic factor. Hereditary hair loss, such as baldness, is the most common complaint among all. Although everyday routines may seem harmless, certain habits can be disastrous to your hair over time. These daily practices can weaken your scalp health without consideration. Let\'s check and see some causes and the reasons behind them.</span></p><h3><span style="color: rgb(67, 67, 67)">1. Frequent washing</span></h3><p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0)">Excessive hair wash sometimes leads to hair fall. This is because overwashing can strip off the natural oil and affect the protective layer on the scalp, which is essential for retaining hair moisturization and protection. This dryness can make hair more prone to brittleness and breakage. Instead of washing the hair daily, try to reduce it to every two to three days, and use sulfate-free shampoos to avoid unnecessary chemicals.</span></p><h3><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0)">2. Hot Water Showers</span></h3><p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0)">Everyone loves hot water showers for its calming and soothing effect. Hot water feels relaxing, but it won\'t go well with your hair. Like skin, bathing in hot water can open up the hair cuticles and strip out the natural oils and moisture. Over time, this can make hair more prone to breakage and shedding. Instead of washing hair with hot water, try to wash your hair with mild, lukewarm or cold water, which helps to maintain the hair’s moisture balance.</span></p><h3><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0)">3. Aggressive Towel Drying</span></h3><p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0)">Rubbing your hair vigorously with a towel may pull and tug at the hair strands. It seems like a quick way to dry it, but it’s actually one of the worst things you can do for your hair. Wet hair can be fragile and aggressive towel drying can lead to breakage and split ends. Instead of wiping the towel on the hair vigorously, gently pat dry with the towel and squeeze out excess water. And most importantly, let the hair and scalp dry on their own.</span></p><h3><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0)">4. Excessive Use of Heat Styling Tools</span></h3><p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0)">Using heating and styling tools more often can be harmful to the hair. In that case, heat styling tools like hair straighteners, curling wands, and hair dryers may give your hair a polished look, but they can cause long-term damage. Frequent use of tools might weaken hair, leading to dryness, breakage, and eventually, hair fall occurs. Always use a heat protectant spray and try to limit heat styling to a few times a week, if you can’t skip the heat styling.</span></p><h3><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0)">5. Tight Hairstyles</span></h3><p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0)">Putting tight hairstyles like tight ponytails, braids, or buns can lead to a condition called traction alopecia. When the hair is pulled back tightly and repeatedly, the constant pressure on the scalp weakens the hair roots and causes hair to pull out, eventually. Go for loose hairstyles as the hair gets some breaks to rest and settle down.</span></p><h3><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0)">6. Using unsuitable Hair Products</span></h3><p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0)">Some chemical-rich products like shampoos, conditioners, and styling products can be harsh on your scalp and hair. Using too many chemicals like sulfates, parabens, and alcohol-based ingredients can soon kill the natural elements on the scalp which dry out your hair. This may not seem a big deal, but frequent usage can stop hair growth gradually. practice natural rich or organic products that are free from these harmful ingredients to ensure your hair\'s health and strength.</span></p><h3><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0)">7. Skipping Hair Protection Outdoors</span></h3><p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0)">Like how skin needs sunscreen, your hair needs some protection too, because it can suffer from environmental exposure. Sunlight, wind, and pollution can all influence hair damage. One of the frightening and challenging things is the harm of UV rays. These UV rays effortlessly cause hair growth and sooner or later affect the health of the hair\'s strength. So wearing suitable hair protection items like hats or products like leave-in conditioners with SPF can save you from hair conditions.&nbsp;</span></p><h3><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0)">8. Poor Diet</span></h3><p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0)">Eating so many junk foods can affect the overall body metabolism. Like they say,” You sow what you reap”, what you eat can reflect in your hair, too. A lack of nutrients like protein, iron, calcium and vitamins can stop hair growth. Nutrients like biotin, vitamin E, and omega-3 fatty acids are especially important for hair growth and strength. These nutrition-rich foods can help the overall metabolism, leading to better absorption of nutrients. Eating plenty of fruits, vegetables, lean proteins, and healthy fats can be a fuel for your hair to strengthen.</span></p><h3><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0)">9. Stress and Hair Loss</span></h3><p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0)">One of the developing and common, conditions for younger generations is stress. The constant worrying and stressing too much can lead to a lack of nutrient absorption. This can be a major miss for proper hair growth. The body\'s mechanism can stop to grab the essential nutrition and redirect to some other parts of the body. A lot of energy is wasted during stress and this stops scalp development. This can lead to a condition called telogen effluvium, where hair follicles prematurely enter the resting phase and fall out. Managing stress and mood swings through relaxation techniques, exercise, or meditation can significantly improve your hair health.</span></p><h2><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0)">10. Not washing properly&nbsp;</span></h2><p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0)">Not washing the hair properly also makes the hair fall, because, if not cleaned properly, the scalp starts to form residues and that condition often indicates constant itching leading to rashes or allergies. Like skin, your hair also needs a good cleanse and exfoliation to open up the pores. So go for the natural cleansing shampoos to make the scalp work with ease, for retaining better moisture and health. An appropriate wash after oiling and a good massage improves the overall health of the hair and scalp, which works like magic.</span></p><h2><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0)">How to Reverse Damage and Improve Hair Health</span></h2><p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0)">Now that we’ve identified the habits contributing to hair fall, it’s time to take action. Here are some tips to restore your hair’s health:</span></p><ul class="list-disc list-outside leading-3 -mt-2"><li class="leading-normal -mb-2"><p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0)">Use gentle, sulfate-free shampoos and conditioners.</span></p></li><li class="leading-normal -mb-2"><p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0)">Avoid excessive heat styling and tight hairstyles.</span></p></li><li class="leading-normal -mb-2"><p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0)">Incorporate scalp massages and oil treatments into your routine.</span></p></li><li class="leading-normal -mb-2"><p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0)">Eat a balanced diet rich in vitamins and minerals.</span></p></li><li class="leading-normal -mb-2"><p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0)">Manage stress with relaxation techniques.</span></p></li></ul><p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0)">Your daily habits can either help or hurt your hair. While some hair loss is normal, excessive shedding could be a sign that your routine needs a few adjustments. By making simple changes—like washing your hair less frequently, being mindful of heat styling, and protecting your hair from environmental damage—you can improve your hair’s health and reduce unnecessary hair fall.

      title: "Diet and Hair Loss Interlinked? Signs you should not ignore.",
      content:
        '<p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0)">There are a few causes of hair loss, and poor diet is one of the first triggers to take into account. You might be snacking on junk foods recently or skipping meals every two times per day. Various food habits like these interfere with hair loss. This blog is all about the diet you should and should not follow. Incorporating these changes will transform your hair even without any external treatments.</span></p><h1><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0)">The Link Between Diet and Hair Loss</span></h1><p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0)">Cutting down on meals or overeating habits can have unfavorable outcomes, such as weight loss and less immunity. Hair loss is another frightful consequence of poor nutrition. Eating less nutritious foods for longer periods may worsen existing hair loss.&nbsp; Hair loss signs to watch include excessive shedding, noticeable thinning, a receding hairline, and brittle hair, especially if you\'re following a very restrictive or low-calorie diet. Eating nutrition-rich foods that promote hair growth is encouraged. The below list of nutrients is the one that you should target.</span></p><h2><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0)">Foods that Trigger Hair Loss</span></h2><p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0)">Certain unhealthy foods harm hair growth. If the foods below are part of your diet, minimize your intake if you want to grow more hair than you lose.</span></p><h3><span style="color: rgb(67, 67, 67)">Carbohydrates</span></h3><p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0)">Indians love rice. It has been part of our day-to-day lives for centuries and is more of a tradition and culture rather than just food—especially for South Indians. Disappointingly, as per the study, diets rich in carbohydrates even in simpler forms may contribute to hair loss. Because carbohydrates increase sebum (oil) production in the scalp. The minimal amount of sebum release is normal to protect the scalp. Whereas, an excess amount of it can lead to inflammation that is harmful to hair health.</span></p><p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0)">Sugary foods such as traditional sweets contain large amounts of carbohydrates. They attack the regulation of insulin hormone, which negatively affects blood vessels in the scalp. People should avoid eating too much carbohydrates, such as cakes, candies, cookies, sweets, rice, pasta, and bread. Eating complex carbohydrates that include grains, beans and vegetables is encouraged.</span></p><h3><span style="color: rgb(67, 67, 67)">Mercury content in Fish</span></h3><p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0)">While fish provides many omega-3 acids that promote hair growth, the mercury content in certain fish affects hair. A study performed with two women experiencing hair loss found they had high mercury levels in their blood from eating fish. The hair loss gradually reduced after stopping the intake of mercury-rich fish.</span></p><p><br>The Food and Drug Administration (FDA) <span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0)">recommends eating 2-3 servings of fish per week due to its high nutritional value. Thus, eating mercury-free fish such as tuna, salmon, and cod, could be beneficial for people experiencing hair loss.</span></p><h3><span style="color: rgb(67, 67, 67)">Fried Foods and Meat</span></h3><p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0)">Deep-fried foods and heavy meat foods affect hair growth and have other negative outcomes such as acne, weight gain, puffy face etc. These foods harm hair health because they trigger the sebum-producing glands to secrete more oil (sebum) on the scalp.</span></p><h2><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0)">Foods that Promotes Hair Growth and Reduce Hair Loss</span></h2><p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0)">Various studies explored the effects of food intake on hair loss. One among them claims that Telogen effluvium (a type of hair loss) may sometimes protrude from lack of deficiency. Eating a balanced diet, including sufficient amounts of protein, vitamins, and minerals, is necessary for hair health and growth. The following are some of the food recommendations:</span></p><h3><span style="color: rgb(67, 67, 67)">Protein</span></h3><p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0)">Every part of our body is made of proteins including hair strands. Proteins are rich in amino acids that are necessary for hair growth. Having enough protein in your plates is important for proper health regulation. A diet with extremely low proteins can cause a slow hair growth rate and sometimes even fall out.&nbsp;</span></p><p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0)">While adding protein to your diet is good, an excess amount of it might negatively impact biotin regulation, a deficiency in turn can cause hair loss. Taking adequate protein according to your BMI is crucial. If you notice brittle hair and shedding recently, consult a nutritionist or doctor for protein intake.</span></p><p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0)">Examples of protein sources include:</span></p><ul class="list-disc list-outside leading-3 -mt-2"><li class="leading-normal -mb-2"><p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0)">cottage cheese</span></p></li><li class="leading-normal -mb-2"><p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0)">Soya chunks</span></p></li><li class="leading-normal -mb-2"><p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0)">yoghurt</span></p></li><li class="leading-normal -mb-2"><p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0)">beans</span></p></li><li class="leading-normal -mb-2"><p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0)">poultry</span></p></li><li class="leading-normal -mb-2"><p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0)">seeds and nuts</span></p></li><li class="leading-normal -mb-2"><p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0)">eggs</span></p></li><li class="leading-normal -mb-2"><p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0)">fish</span></p></li></ul><h3><span style="color: rgb(67, 67, 67)">Healthy Fats</span></h3><p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0)">There are two types of Fats—saturated and unsaturated. Saturated fats can increase bad cholesterol in your body and are often found in processed foods. Unsaturated fats are healthier one step ahead compared to saturated fats. They hydrate hair and promote hair growth too. Some sources include:</span><br></p><ul class="list-disc list-outside leading-3 -mt-2"><li class="leading-normal -mb-2"><p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0)">fatty fish, such as salmon</span></p></li><li class="leading-normal -mb-2"><p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0)">flax seeds</span></p></li><li class="leading-normal -mb-2"><p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0)">walnuts</span></p></li><li class="leading-normal -mb-2"><p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0)">olive oil</span></p></li></ul><h3><span style="color: rgb(67, 67, 67)">Vitamin C</span></h3><p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0)">Vitamin C is popular in the world of skincare to achieve glowing skin. Besides, it can also play a major role in giving healthy hair. Hair needs collagen as much as it demands protein. Vitamin C produces adequate collagen ideal for luscious hair.&nbsp;</span></p><p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0)">Most importantly, Vitamin C is anti-viral and anti-bacterial which can keep your scalp balanced and reduce dandruff. Androgenetic alopecia or male pattern baldness due to inadequate testosterone has been a widespread complaint among men. Vitamin C has proven its efficiency in preventing hair loss by inhibiting dihydrotestosterone(DHT), which is a leading cause of some forms of baldness. Some of the vitamin C-rich foods include:</span><br></p><ul class="list-disc list-outside leading-3 -mt-2"><li class="leading-normal -mb-2"><p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0)">Green, leafy vegetables</span></p></li><li class="leading-normal -mb-2"><p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0)">Strawberries</span></p></li><li class="leading-normal -mb-2"><p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0)">Citrus fruits</span></p></li><li class="leading-normal -mb-2"><p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0)">Potatoes</span></p></li><li class="leading-normal -mb-2"><p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0)">Peppers</span></p></li><li class="leading-normal -mb-2"><p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0)">Broccoli</span></p></li></ul><h3><span style="color: rgb(67, 67, 67)">Biotin</span></h3><p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0)">Biotin, also called Vitamin B7 is a deciding factor in hair loss. Lack of biotin leads to hair thinning and loss. In fact, it is primarily used to reduce scalp inflammation. Biotin subsidies the cell reactions, making the skin less sensitive to triggers.&nbsp;</span></p><p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0)">Taking biotin supplements is an alternative option and consuming the right amount is no harm. The daily recommendation for biotin is 30 micrograms for adults. In the case of Alopecia (hair loss), your doctor may recommend up to 3 milligrams per day. Always consult a doctor before biotin intake to check the deficiency. Some of the biotin-abundant foods are</span><br></p><ul class="list-disc list-outside leading-3 -mt-2"><li class="leading-normal -mb-2"><p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0)">Beef liver</span></p></li><li class="leading-normal -mb-2"><p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0)">Eggs</span></p></li><li class="leading-normal -mb-2"><p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0)">Salmon</span></p></li><li class="leading-normal -mb-2"><p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0)">Pork chop&nbsp;</span></p></li><li class="leading-normal -mb-2"><p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0)">Sweet potatoes&nbsp;</span></p></li><li class="leading-normal -mb-2"><p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0)">Almonds&nbsp;</span></p></li><li class="leading-normal -mb-2"><p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0)">Broccoli</span></p></li></ul><h3><span style="color: rgb(67, 67, 67)">Niacin</span></h3><p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0)">Another important person from the Vitamin B family is Niacin (Vitamin B3) which equally plays a role as Biotin. It offers a range of hair benefits including increasing blood circulation, reducing scalp inflammation, increasing keratin (an essential protein for hair) production and improving hair texture. Hair loss gets reduced by the work of these perks together.&nbsp;</span></p><p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0)">Niacin intake can be taken through diet or supplements in the form of tablets, capsules, or pills. The recommended daily amount is 16 mg for adult males and 14 mg for adult women. There are topical niacin applications such as shampoo, serum or hair masks that you can buy. Some of the Niacin-rich foods are;</span></p><ul class="list-disc list-outside leading-3 -mt-2"><li class="leading-normal -mb-2"><p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0)">Bananas</span></p></li><li class="leading-normal -mb-2"><p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0)">Broccoli</span></p></li><li class="leading-normal -mb-2"><p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0)">Brown Rice</span></p></li><li class="leading-normal -mb-2"><p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0)">Spinach</span></p></li><li class="leading-normal -mb-2"><p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0)">Nuts</span></p></li><li class="leading-normal -mb-2"><p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0)">Tuna</span></p></li><li class="leading-normal -mb-2"><p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0)">Marinara sauce</span></p></li><li class="leading-normal -mb-2"><p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0)">Whole grains</span></p></li><li class="leading-normal -mb-2"><p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0)">Peanuts</span></p></li><li class="leading-normal -mb-2"><p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0)">Seeds</span></p></li></ul><h3><span style="color: rgb(67, 67, 67)">Iron</span></h3><p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0)">Iron deficiency is one of the common occurrences in today’s lives due to factors like weight loss, inadequate blood count and so on. But it directly links to hair loss. In fact, telogen effluvium, which affects the hair growth cycle, has some impact on the iron content in our body. Further deficiency may worsen the condition. Your doctor may suggest you include iron-content foods such as:</span></p><ul class="list-disc list-outside leading-3 -mt-2"><li class="leading-normal -mb-2"><p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0)">liver&nbsp;</span></p></li><li class="leading-normal -mb-2"><p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0)">red meat.</span></p></li><li class="leading-normal -mb-2"><p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0)">beans, such as red kidney beans, edamame beans and chickpeas.</span></p></li><li class="leading-normal -mb-2"><p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0)">nuts.</span></p></li><li class="leading-normal -mb-2"><p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0)">dried fruit – such as dried apricots.</span></p></li><li class="leading-normal -mb-2"><p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0)">fortified breakfast cereals.</span></p></li><li class="leading-normal -mb-2"><p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0)">soybean flour.</span></p><p></p></li></ul><p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0)">In worse conditions, you might have to take iron supplements to aid better recovery.</span></p><h3><span style="color: rgb(67, 67, 67)">Zinc</span></h3><p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0)">Zinc is a mineral that plays important roles in immune function, protein synthesis, cellular division, and more. Hair follicles shrink and have a slow growth rate seasonally. Zinc regulates the follicle balance and its recovery. Various people with hair loss conditions tend to have zinc deficiency than people without hair loss. Zinc is available in foods such as;&nbsp;</span></p><ul class="list-disc list-outside leading-3 -mt-2"><li class="leading-normal -mb-2"><p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0)">Oysters</span></p></li><li class="leading-normal -mb-2"><p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0)">Nuts</span></p></li><li class="leading-normal -mb-2"><p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0)">Seeds</span></p></li><li class="leading-normal -mb-2"><p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0)">Legumes</span></p></li><li class="leading-normal -mb-2"><p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0)">Tofu</span></p></li><li class="leading-normal -mb-2"><p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0)">Shellfish</span></p></li><li class="leading-normal -mb-2"><p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0)">Red meat</span></p><p></p></li></ul><p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0)">Or you could take iron supplements to speed up the process.

      title: "Foods that Help Combat Dandruff",
      content:
        '<p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0)">Dandruff might be the biggest problem you\'re facing right now. Those little flakes can be uncomfortable, pesky and troublesome at times—the bad feeling when you struggle to hide those visible flakes that should not exist. Various reasons induce dandruff. Some causes are oily skin, dry skin, improper scalp maintenance, etc. External solutions might temporarily combat dandruff, but internal approaches like the right food intake can help prevent and reduce dandruff in the long run.</span></p><h1><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0)">Nutrient Breakdown of Foods&nbsp;</span></h1><p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0)">The categorized version of nutrients helps you discover foods according to your preference. Not only facilitates but also projects an overview of the idea of picking what nutrient you lack. Note these nutrients and incorporate them into your diet.</span></p><h3><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0)">Omega-3-fatty acids</span></h3><p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0)">Omega-3 fatty acids can help in a number of ways such as;</span></p><h4><span style="color: rgb(102, 102, 102)">Regulates oil production:&nbsp;</span></h4><p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0)">Each one of us has a varied amount of scalp oil production. Some produce excess oil, which makes the hair look down. Omega-3s can help control the amount of oil your scalp produces.&nbsp;</span></p><h4><span style="color: rgb(102, 102, 102)">Reduces inflammation:&nbsp;</span></h4><p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0)">Sensitive skin scalp has a higher chance of acquiring inflammation. It gets triggered easily even in normal conditions. Omega-3s have anti-inflammatory properties that can help reduce inflammation and the symptoms of dandruff.</span></p><h4><span style="color: rgb(102, 102, 102)">Nourishes hair follicles:&nbsp;</span></h4><p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0)">A healthy scalp equals healthy hair. Dandruff is an obvious damage to the scalp. Omega-3s can promote healthy hair growth and minimize issues like dandruff.</span></p><h3><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0)">Vitamin B6 and B12</span></h3><p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0)">Vitamins and minerals are our helping siblings. The twin vitamins—B6 and B12 are the deciding nutrients of our hair’s fate. Pyridoxine, shortly called Vitamin B6 is very crucial for healthy hair. Lack of B6 invites dandruff. On the other hand, Vitamin B12 helps in the following</span></p><h4><span style="color: rgb(102, 102, 102)">Moisturizes scalp</span></h4><p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0)">Vitamin B12 helps produce sebum, the natural oil that lubricates the scalp and hair follicles. This can help keep the scalp moisturized and free from irritation.&nbsp;</span></p><h4><span style="color: rgb(102, 102, 102)">Balances pH levels</span></h4><p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0)">The ideal pH of a healthy scalp is around 5.5. Signs that your scalp is too alkaline (pH level below 5) include an itchy or flaky scalp, or flare-ups of eczema, dandruff, or bacteria. Vitamin B12 can help balance the pH levels of the scalp and also control oil production.&nbsp;</span></p><h4><span style="color: rgb(102, 102, 102)">Reduces inflammation</span></h4><p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0)">Vitamin B12 can act as an anti-inflammatory on the scalp, helping to heal infections and protect against dry and itchy scalp. Besides, it can help make hair smoother and more manageable.</span></p><h3><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0)">Zinc and Selenium</span></h3><p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0)">Lack of Zinc reduces the skin’s barrier to dandruff. Moreover, it has a direct link with hormonal function. Low levels of androgens can cause dandruff and slow hair growth. Zinc can help regulate androgen levels. Zinc pyrithione is an ingredient in many dandruff shampoos and soaps. It is one of the most common and effective anti-dandruff ingredients.</span></p><p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0)">Selenium is a mineral that can help fight dandruff by combating the fungus that causes it. Many anti-dandruff treatments contain selenium, but it\'s important to only take it in the required quantities. The recommended daily amounts of selenium are;</span></p><ul class="list-disc list-outside leading-3 -mt-2"><li class="leading-normal -mb-2"><p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0)">birth to 6 months: 15 micrograms (mcg)</span></p></li><li class="leading-normal -mb-2"><p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0)">infants 7–12 months: 20 mcg</span></p></li><li class="leading-normal -mb-2"><p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0)">children 1–3 years: 20 mcg</span></p></li><li class="leading-normal -mb-2"><p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0)">children 4–8 years: 30 mcg</span></p></li><li class="leading-normal -mb-2"><p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0)">children 9–13 years: 40 mcg</span></p></li><li class="leading-normal -mb-2"><p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0)">teenagers 14–18 years: 55 mcg</span></p></li><li class="leading-normal -mb-2"><p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0)">adults: 55 mcg</span></p></li><li class="leading-normal -mb-2"><p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0)">a person who is pregnant: 60 mcg</span></p></li><li class="leading-normal -mb-2"><p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0)">a person who is breastfeeding: 70 mcg</span></p></li></ul><h3><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0)">Probiotics</span></h3><p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0)">Probiotics are effective in reducing dandruff on your scalp. A study revealed that this probiotic induced a faster recovery of the skin barrier function, regulated the skin\'s immune system, reduced scalp greasiness, and most importantly reduced the Malassezia yeast population on the scalp.</span></p><h3><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0)">Biotin (Vitamin B7)</span></h3><p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0)">A lack of biotin can lead to a dry, flaky scalp and dandruff. Biotin deficiency can also cause brittle hair that\'s prone to splitting. Taking too much biotin can cause a rash that looks like psoriasis. These red, itchy bumps can last for days and be very uncomfortable. Thus, take the doctor’s suggestion before intake.</span></p><h2><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0)">Add These Foods to Your Plates if You Have Dandruff</span></h2><p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0)">Now that we have broken down the nutrients, we have given a few nutrient-rich foods for each category. Covering these foods alone could transform your scalp’s health.</span></p><h3><span style="color: rgb(67, 67, 67)">Fatty Fish</span></h3><p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0)">Fatty fish such as salmon and tuna are a great source of healthy fats. Regular consumption of unhealthy fats can worsen pre-existing dandruff while healthy fats may help reduce it. Fatty fish are also rich in omega-3 fatty acids which promotes better hair and scalp health.</span></p><h3><span style="color: rgb(67, 67, 67)">Eggs</span></h3><p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0)">Eggs are very rich in zinc and biotin. Foods rich in these components promote better health of our scalp and hair. Our scalp releases sebum. Sebum is the natural oil produced by the body to help protect our scalp from damage. Excess sebum may also cause dandruff which may be stopped through eating foods rich in zinc and biotin.</span></p><h3><span style="color: rgb(67, 67, 67)">Avocados</span></h3><p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0)">Avocados are a great source of healthy fats for plant-based dieters. They are very healthy and versatile. This makes it easy to add them to our diet. Other plant-based healthy fats-rich foods are olive oil, peanut butter, flaxseeds, etc.</span></p><h3><span style="color: rgb(67, 67, 67)">Nuts</span></h3><p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0)">Nuts are another plant-based source of healthy fats. They are also rich in zinc and various other vitamins and nutrients that have been directly linked to improving one\'s overall health. A good intake of healthy fats can help nourish the scalp and reduce dandruff.</span></p><h3><span style="color: rgb(67, 67, 67)">Bananas&nbsp;</span></h3><p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0)">Bananas are another great source of zinc and biotin. Bananas also help manage sebum in the scalp and may be beneficial for your overall health. You can add bananas in various ways to your diet.</span></p><h3><span style="color: rgb(67, 67, 67)">Coconut Oil</span></h3><p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0)">Some studies claim that coconut oil can help combat dandruff naturally inside and out. Its anti-inflammatory, anti-fungal and anti-bacterial effects potentially prevent and remove the dandruff-causing fungus Malassezia. This works the same if taken with meals.&nbsp;</span></p><h3><span style="color: rgb(67, 67, 67)">Yoghurt</span></h3><p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0)">Yoghurt and various other probiotic foods are great for our health. Probiotics have been proven to improve our immune system. A strong immune system can reduce the risk of fungus-caused dandruff.</span></p><h3><span style="color: rgb(67, 67, 67)">Tofu</span></h3><p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0)">Tofu is another great source of protein and zinc. Eating protein-rich foods can help cure dandruff and many other hair problems. It also helps maintain proper levels of moisture in the scalp.</span></p><h2><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0)">Foods to avoid for Dandruff-Free Scalp</span></h2><h3><span style="color: rgb(67, 67, 67)">Sugar</span></h3><p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0)">We exchange sweets even in small celebrations, that is how we are brought up. Although taking sugar in smaller quantities is good, exceeding the limit is a bad trade. Cutting back may lower inflammation, minimising the appearance of flakes. Diets that have sugary foods create insulin hormone spikes which increase sebum (oil production). And eventually, sebum facilitates dandruff incoming.</span></p><p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0)">Taking sugar-processed foods in minimal quantities will help resolve this problem. Hence, it creates the right balance of the scalp.</span></p><h3><span style="color: rgb(67, 67, 67)">Alcohol</span></h3><p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0)">Alcohol is something you should&nbsp; avoid for dandruff free scalp. Alcohol booze has several health hazards, and skin dehydration is one among them. The more your skin gets dry, the more you have a chance of getting dandruff. Dandruff loves oily and dry skin conditions. Alcohol can also weaken the immune system, making it harder for your body to fight off the yeast that causes dandruff.</span></p><h3><span style="color: rgb(67, 67, 67)">Processed Food</span></h3><p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0)">Processed foods are no source of nutrients and have large amounts of salts contributing to dryness. Intaking them simply makes you less immune to any infections including dandruff. These foods can also be high in unhealthy fats and sugars, which can promote inflammation.</span></p><h3><span style="color: rgb(67, 67, 67)">Dairy Products</span></h3><p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0)">For some individuals, dairy may trigger seborrheic dermatitis, one of the main causes of dandruff. Dairy can contribute to increased oil production and inflammation in some people, leading to a more conducive environment for Malassezia.</span></p><p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0)">For more more about hair care, check out our blog section.&nbsp;</span></p>',

        "Can Hard Water Cause Dandruff: Effective Solutions for Flake-Free Hair.",
      content:
        '<p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0)">Do you end up with dry hair every time you wash, despite using conditioners? Chances are you might be rinsing off using hard water. Well, you would have heard this term before in school or college as a student. Back then, our teachers might not have taught us that hard water could actually damage hair, making our scalp more prone to dandruff. But, it is never too late to learn and prevent dandruff induced by it. This blog is all about hard water, what role it plays in hair maintenance, the disadvantages and the solutions provided.&nbsp;</span></p><h1><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0)">What Exactly is Hard Water?</span></h1><p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0)">We call it hard water when the water has minerals in higher concentrations. Hard water contains two primary minerals: magnesium sulfate and calcium. Both barely dissolve with other substances if used along. For example, if you use hard water with shampoo, the minerals of hard water do not dissolve with the molecules of shampoo. As a result, you see a pile of lather stuck up in the sink.</span></p><h2><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0)">How Could I Know Whether am Using Hard Water?</span></h2><p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0)">You might doubt if the water you use is the water that we are talking about. Identifying hard water is a one-step simple process. When you are done washing off, look at your bathroom sink for lather residues. If so, then your home supplies hard water. Another method of finding it is through a soap test. Fill a clean, empty bottle one-third full with tap water, add a few drops of pure liquid soap, and shake vigorously. If the water is cloudy or milky and there are few bubbles, the water is hard. The bonus sign of hard water is when your taps and faucets have mineral stains on them. Verify using these methods to identify the hard water.</span></p><h2><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0)">Hard Water Invites Dandruff.</span></h2><p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0)">If you confirm hard water, you should also know what it can do and why it should be avoided, especially for people with scalp issues. It can create a handful of hair problems or intensify the existing challenges.&nbsp;</span></p><h3><span style="color: rgb(67, 67, 67)">Leaves Residues</span></h3><p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0)">Our scalp is a denser area than other hairy parts of the body. This condition takes in infections through the use of fingers, nails, and combs. When we use hard water, it leaves product build-ups on the scalp without getting washed off properly. Eventually, these residues contribute to dandruff (caused by Malassezia fungus).</span></p><h3><span style="color: rgb(67, 67, 67)">Frizz and Dryness</span></h3><p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0)">The hair should be hydrated to be healthier. Hard water strips off all the natural oils from the scalp as well as strands. This makes hair dry and brittle. The chances of getting split ends are higher in the case of using hard water. The total loss of moisture from your hair makes it look bare and unruly—which sometimes creates difficult tangles to remove.</span></p><h3><span style="color: rgb(67, 67, 67)">Dullness</span></h3><p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0)">Everyone\'s dream is to have shiny and luscious locks. Nobody could ever deny this. Using hard water will strip down the moisture you have been taking care of. Despite treating hair with hydrating ingredients like aloe vera and flaxseeds, hard water may rip out the moisture.</span></p><h3><span style="color: rgb(67, 67, 67)">Weakens Hair Strength</span></h3><p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0)">The minerals in hard water may affect your hair structure and make it more prone to damage and breakage.</span></p><h2><br><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0)">Signs of Hard Water on Dandruff</span></h2><p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0)">Hard water can literally damage the strength of your hair by increasing frizziness and dullness. Besides, its habit of leaving residue over the scalp and inviting dandruff is the worst of all. Many of us might have been victims of hard water. Look for these symptoms. Chances are you might already have undergone these signs.</span></p><h3><span style="color: rgb(67, 67, 67)">Scalp irritation</span></h3><p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0)">The minerals in hard water can irritate your scalp, leading to itchy scalp and flakiness. This irritation can induce dandruff or worsen an existing condition.</span></p><h3><span style="color: rgb(67, 67, 67)">Shampoo underperformance</span></h3><p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0)">Hard water hinders shampoos from lathering properly. When shampoo doesn\'t lather as expected, it might not cleanse your scalp and hair effectively, leaving behind residues that contribute to dandruff.</span></p><h3><span style="color: rgb(67, 67, 67)">More split ends</span></h3><p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0)">The presence of minerals can stripe off all your natural oils from both the scalp and hair ends. Due to moisture loss, the hair has more chance of getting split ends frequently than normal. Such conditions make the hair look unpleasing and totally damage the welfare of the hair.</span></p><h3><span style="color: rgb(67, 67, 67)">Thin hair</span></h3><p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0)">Magnesium and calcium have the potential to affect your hair structure, facilitating the bringing forth of dandruff, intensively damaging the hair and increasing breakage. This results in creating a look of thin and vulnerable hair.</span></p><h2><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0)">Solutions for hard water-damaged hair</span></h2><p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0)">Setting up a water softener to filter hard water can be expensive. Though it is not everyone’s cup of solutions, we can opt for alternative solutions to prevent hard water from affecting the health of your scalp and hair. The good news is it is very simple to follow.&nbsp;</span></p><h3><span style="color: rgb(67, 67, 67)">Use clarifying shampoo</span></h3><p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0)">Using clarifying shampoos is great for removing excess oils and product buildup. The residue left by hard water can be quite managed with the use of clarifying shampoo.</span></p><h3><span style="color: rgb(67, 67, 67)">Apple Cider Vinegar (ACV)&nbsp;</span></h3><p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0)">Apple cider vinegar rinse is an alternative if you want a budget-friendly residue remover. Besides its tremendous effects on transforming skin into a glowing one and adding shine to the hair, it can get rid of hard water too. The minerals are basic, and apple cider vinegar\'s acidity gently balances the scalp\'s pH level, hence removing residues effortlessly. Mix one part apple cider vinegar with three parts water, apply it after shampooing, and rinse thoroughly.</span></p><h3><span style="color: rgb(67, 67, 67)">Deep conditioning&nbsp;</span></h3><p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0)">Deep conditioning on the other hand helps the scalp and hair retain its moisture that’s pulled down by hard water. Choose products with ingredients like shea butter, aloe vera and argan oil to hydrate and strengthen your hair.</span></p><h3><span style="color: rgb(67, 67, 67)">Scalp treatments</span></h3><p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0)">Use anti-dandruff shampoos like Sebamed, which contain properties to heal any form of itchiness, dryness, fungal growth, and flaking without compromising the nourishment and shine of your hair.</span></p><h3><span style="color: rgb(67, 67, 67)">Use cold or warm water</span></h3><p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0)">Hot water can strip your hair of its natural oils, which is harmful when dealing with hard water. Use lukewarm or cool water for hair washing to minimise moisture loss.</span></p><p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0)">For more useful information, read our previous and upcoming blogs related to skincare and hair care. </span></p><p><br></p>',

      title: "Benefits of Apple Cider Vinegar for Hair",
      content:
        '<p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0)">Apple Cider Vinegar (ACV) is a very popular ingredient, used for weight loss to glowing skin. If you ask whether apple cider vinegar is safe on hair despite its name, that sounds similar to the vinegar we cook. Yes, this affordable ACV solution is safe to use on hair and offers a wide range of benefits. The best thing is it is one of the most accessible home products or ingredients—very easy to use and a small amount solves the biggest hair problems in less time.</span></p><p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0)">This blog is all about the benefits of Apple Cider Vinegar (ACV), how to DIY it and its supremacy. Without further delay. Let us get into the topic.</span></p><h1><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0)">How do they make Apple Cider Vinegar?</span></h1><p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0)">We would have wondered about the process behind the making of ACV—a common question that strikes us while buying from the market. Just like grapes becoming a premium version called wine, Apple gets fermented several times—the first round with carbohydrates and yeast, where the alcohol to acetic acid conversion takes place. Following this, we get two variants, a raw and unfiltered ACV and a filtered form. The raw ones look quite cloudy compared to the filtered ACV.</span></p><h2><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0)">Benefits of Apple Cider Vinegar</span></h2><p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0)">The usage of ACV began in ancient days to treat medical issues like acid reflux, and cough. It continues dwelling among people with added discovery benefits such as weight loss, beauty remedies or adding shine to hair. Focusing on hair, ACV is one dynamic natural ingredient that aids in healthy hair growth and offers many more.&nbsp;</span></p><h3><span style="color: rgb(67, 67, 67)">Adds shine and stops colour fade</span></h3><p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0)">The enzymes present in ACV enclose and shield the hair cuticles, leaving a smooth and shiny appearance. This phenomenon protects proteins, lipids and vitals from leaking out of cuticles. Because of this mechanism, ACV also keeps your hair frizz-free and prevents colour from fading out.</span></p><h3><span style="color: rgb(67, 67, 67)">Cleanses and Increases volume and texture</span></h3><p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0)">Some might see the sign of an oily scalp within two days of washing. This is because the leftover product builds up and the excess oil, not getting properly washed away. The oily hair strands might weigh down, creating an uncomfortable picture of thin and less hair. ACV solution helps clear out the excess builds, achieving a clear scalp with luscious and moisture-balanced strands immediately.</span></p><h3><span style="color: rgb(67, 67, 67)">Relieves itchy scalp and dandruff</span></h3><p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0)">Thanks to its antibacterial and antifungal properties, ACV prevents bacterial and fungal growth on the scalp. In fact, Dandruff, scientifically known as Malassezia, is a common fungal infection which can be removed with the help of ACV. It has remarkable potential in removing dandruff, clearing the flakes, and facilitating an itchy-free scalp.</span></p><p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0)">The anti-inflammatory property of ACV prevents the scalp from becoming allergic and irritant‌. If you have a sensitive scalp, ACV is an effective home remedy for dandruff and is flexible for all hair types.</span></p><h3><span style="color: rgb(67, 67, 67)">Stimulates Hair Growth</span></h3><p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0)">Hair thinning and hair loss are common complaints among us. ACV’s acidity and pH balancing efficiency stimulate hair growth and eventually create a space to grow luscious and thick hair. Most of the shampoos out here have inaccurate pH levels. This may not support scalp pH regulation, eventually leading to excessive hair fall. Unnecessary hair fall can be prevented by using the ACV solution.</span></p><h3><span style="color: rgb(67, 67, 67)">Acidity PH</span></h3><p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0)">You get to smell an ounce of pungency and a strong odor while uncorking the ACV bottle. This is because of the presence of acetic acid, which has over 2 to 3 natural pH levels—means highly acidic. Any pH level beyond 7 is considered alkaline. Brittle, frizzy, and dull hair is more alkaline or higher on the pH scale. ACV solution helps restore pH to the optimal value, between 3 and 5, which favors precise hair growth.</span></p><h3><span style="color: rgb(67, 67, 67)">Regulates Blood circulation</span></h3><p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0)">When you comb, your scalp gets a deep massage. Product build-ups act as a roadblock where the scalp skin gets no chance of touching the comb’s tip. Being an excellent exfoliator, ACV gets rid of dead skin, excess build-ups and itchy flakes. This eventually facilitates scalp blood circulation by stimulating the hair root\'s head.</span></p><h2><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0)">How to Use Apple Cider Vinegar at Home</span></h2><p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0)">One of the best doctors from the U.S., </span><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" class="text-black underline underline-offset-[3px] hover:text-black cursor-pointer" href="https://www.drberg.com/"><span style="color: rgb(17, 85, 204)"><u>Dr. Berg</u></span></a><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0)">, answers how to DIY apple cider vinegar solution at home. He says that its acetic and higher concentration damages the scalp and hair in its raw form. Diluting the ACV with water helps reduce the concentration, making it optimal to use.&nbsp;</span></p><p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0)">He suggests mixing 1 tablespoon of ACV with 16 ounces of water and not letting it sit for a longer time. You want to basically use it as a rinse after the shampoo and conditioner if that is what you use. And he recommends not doing it every single day, maybe once or twice a week is fine—saying this is the right way of using it.&nbsp;</span></p><h2><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0)">Debunking common myths on ACV</span></h2><h3><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0)"><strong>Myth: ACV can permanently cure dandruff</strong></span></h3><p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0)"><strong>Fact</strong>: ACV has antifungal properties that may help control dandruff (such as Malassezia), but it won’t cure underlying conditions like </span><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" class="text-black underline underline-offset-[3px] hover:text-black cursor-pointer" href="https://my.clevelandclinic.org/health/diseases/14403-seborrheic-dermatitis"><span style="color: rgb(17, 85, 204)"><u>seborrheic dermatitis</u></span></a><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0)"> or </span><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" class="text-black underline underline-offset-[3px] hover:text-black cursor-pointer" href="https://my.clevelandclinic.org/health/diseases/6866-psoriasis"><span style="color: rgb(17, 85, 204)"><u>psoriasis</u></span></a><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0)">. Consistent use can help manage dandruff, but it is not a permanent solution.</span></p><h3><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0)"><strong>Myth: The stronger the concentration of ACV, the better for your hair.</strong></span></h3><p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0)"><strong>Fact</strong>: Using undiluted or highly concentrated ACV can lead to scalp irritation, dryness, or even hair damage. ACV is acidic, and it is important to dilute it with water (typically 1 part ACV to 3-4 parts water) to avoid causing harm to your scalp and hair.</span></p><h3><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0)"><strong>Myth: ACV can repair split ends</strong></span></h3><p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0)"><strong>Fact</strong>: There is no scientific evidence to suggest that ACV directly promotes faster hair growth. While it can help improve health by balancing pH and reducing build-up, which may support a healthier environment for hair growth, it does not accelerate the hair growth process itself.</span></p><h3><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0)"><strong>Myth: ACV will lighten hair naturally</strong></span></h3><p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0)"><strong>Fact</strong>: ACV is not a natural hair lightener, while it may make your hair look shinier, it won’t significantly change your hair colour. The acidic nature of ACV can help remove mineral buildup from hard water, which can enhance your hair’s natural shine, but it won’t lighten the pigment.</span></p><h2><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0)">Tips to use Apple Cider Vinegar</span></h2><ul class="list-disc list-outside leading-3 -mt-2"><li class="leading-normal -mb-2"><p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0)">The ACV arouses an unpleasant smell. Add a few drops of rosemary oil or rose water to subside its foul odour.</span></p></li><li class="leading-normal -mb-2"><p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0)">Do not use this twice a week. Only once is more than enough to prevent soreness and dry hair.</span></p></li><li class="leading-normal -mb-2"><p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0)">Stop using it if irritation persists. Avoid using under medical conditions.</span></p></li><li class="leading-normal -mb-2"><p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0)">ACV is a dry skin-causing. So, keep your scalp well moisturised.</span></p></li><li class="leading-normal -mb-2"><p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0)">ACV may make your skin more sensitive to the sun. Be sure to continue to use sunscreen throughout the winter.</span></p></li><li class="leading-normal -mb-2"><p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0)">Never use ACV straight.

How long should I leave apple cider vinegar on my hair?</strong></span></h4><p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0)">Although there is no fixed time to let it sit on the hair. Doctors and trichologists suggest leaving it between 10-15 minutes and rinse off immediately.</span></p><h4><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0)"><strong>2. Is apple cider vinegar good for frizzy hair?</strong></span></h4><p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0)">Apple Cider Vinegar is a great option for oily hair. It absorbs the oils and leaves the scalp clean. But because of its acidic nature, it dries up the scalp and increases frizziness. This may not help effectively to frizz hair comparatively.</span></p><p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0)"><strong>3. How to use apple cider vinegar for hair dandruff?</strong></span></p><p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0)">Mix 1 teaspoon of apple cider vinegar (ACV) with warm water. Apply the apple cider vinegar wash to the head after shampooing the hair. Massage the mixture into the scalp with your fingertips. Before rinsing it out, let the mixture settle for a few minutes.</span></p><p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0)"><strong>4. Is it safe to use vinegar on hair?</strong></span></p><p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0)">Yes, it\'s safe to use diluted vinegar on the hair. It helps with shine, scalp health, and removing buildup. Always dilute with water to avoid irritation.</span></p><p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0)"><strong>5. What are the side effects of apple cider vinegar?</strong></span></p><p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0)">Apple cider vinegar can cause scalp irritation, dryness, and hair breakage if used undiluted or too frequently.

Can I mix apple cider vinegar with shampoo?</strong></span></p><p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0)">Undoubtedly, apple cider vinegar works wonders as a clarifying shampoo. To get rid of buildup, extra oil, and product residue from your scalp and hair, use it by itself or in conjunction with your usual shampoo. It also aids in preventing dandruff and soothing an inflamed, itchy scalp.</span></p><p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0)"><strong>7. Does vinegar make hair shiny?</strong></span></p><p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0)">Yes, vinegar, especially apple cider vinegar, makes hair shiny by removing residue and balancing the scalp\'s pH, leading to smoother and more reflective hair strands.</span></p><p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0)"><strong>8. Will apple cider vinegar make my hair smell?</strong></span></p><p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0)">No, ACV won\'t give out a salad dressing scent in your hair. When using and applying the ACV, the smell is really strong, but after washing it out, all that\'s left is naturally clean-smelling hair free of filth or debris.</span></p>',

      title: "Four Stages of the Hair Growth Cycle",
      content:
        '<p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0)">We may think that hair growth and fall are the only things everybody knows. But there is more to it. Just like there is a life cycle for us —similarly there are four stages of the hair growth life cycle that nobody speaks of. Most of us would not have heard about it.</span></p><p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0)">You should know what is happening to your hair and the causes that disrupt its life cycle. Taking precautionary activities will prevent unnecessary hair falls. This blog helps you figure out the science behind hair growth, the causes that break the hair growth cycle, ways to enhance hair growth and questions like how much hair shedding is normal.</span></p><p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0)">Let us dive into the topic.</span></p><h1><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0)">Four Stages of Hair Growth Life Cycle</span></h1><h3><span style="color: rgb(67, 67, 67)">Anagen: The Growth phase</span></h3><p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0)">The anagen phase, AKA “active phase,” is where your hair growth occurs. The root cells divide rapidly and produce new hairs. It can lead from 5 to 7 years, which means this is the longest phase. The anagen phase is not the same for everyone. It can differ from person to person. This is because of different hair types. For some, the eyebrows, pubic hair and underarm hair might have an extended anagen period compared to scalp hairs.&nbsp;</span></p><p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0)">During this phase, the hairs keep growing until they get trimmed or reach their end lifespan and fall off. Almost 90 percent of your hair remains in the anagen phase.</span></p><h3><span style="color: rgb(67, 67, 67)">Catagen: Transition Phase</span></h3><p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0)">The catagen phase is where your hair follicles shrink, blocking its blood supply and yet the hair remains on your scalp. This means the hair growth phase has stopped and is waiting for the next phase. This period lasts for 10 days. Around 3 to 5 percent of your hair stays in the transition phase.</span></p><h3><span style="color: rgb(67, 67, 67)">Telogen: Resting Phase</span></h3><p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0)">Telogen, or resting phase, is where your hair rests or remains in the hair follicles, but its active growth period ends. This phase lasts around 3 months. And between 10-15 percent of your hair experience the telogen phase. Some experts consider the telogen phase as the shedding phase, but scientists have divided this phase into two: the telogen and the exogen.</span></p><h3><span style="color: rgb(67, 67, 67)">Exogen: Pre-growth phase or shedding phase</span></h3><p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0)">Exogen is the final stage of the hair growth cycle, which lasts about 2 to 5 months. The hair falls out of the hair follicles and you see hairs coming off after showering or combing. Losing 50 to 100 hairs per day is normal during this phase.</span></p><h2><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0)">FAQ: How much hair fall is normal?</span></h2><p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0)">For a person, it is normal to see 50 to 100 hair strands falling per day. Anything beyond this limit is a serious consideration. Consult a doctor immediately.&nbsp;</span></p><h2><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0)">Factors that trigger the hair growth cycle</span></h2><p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0)">Some factors can disrupt the normal hair growth cycle, which results in excess hair fall. Knowing these triggers and implementing the solution will save the slipping hair.</span><br></p><ul class="list-disc list-outside leading-3 -mt-2"><li class="leading-normal -mb-2"><p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0)">Metabolic imbalance</span></p></li><li class="leading-normal -mb-2"><p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0)">Thyroid diseases</span></p></li><li class="leading-normal -mb-2"><p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0)">Poor nutrition</span></p></li><li class="leading-normal -mb-2"><p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0)">High fever</span></p></li><li class="leading-normal -mb-2"><p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0)">Acute illness</span></p></li><li class="leading-normal -mb-2"><p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0)">Hormonal imbalance</span></p></li><li class="leading-normal -mb-2"><p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0)">Stress and anxiety</span></p></li><li class="leading-normal -mb-2"><p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0)">Medications</span></p></li><li class="leading-normal -mb-2"><p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0)">Chemotherapy</span></p></li><li class="leading-normal -mb-2"><p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0)">Improper Sleep</span></p></li><li class="leading-normal -mb-2"><p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0)">Improper Hair Care</span></p><p></p></li></ul><p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0)">These conditions may disrupt the hair growth cycle and create unnecessary hair loss—where the phases’ lifespan gets damaged. For example, poor nutrition will cut short the anagen phase\'s longevity. Such a phenomenon will push more hairs to the next phases (telogen), resulting in a large amount of hair fall.&nbsp;</span></p><p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0)">Contrarily, factors like metabolic imbalance, acute illness, hormonal imbalance, and chemotherapy are out of our control. For instance, some people have lower metabolic rates, which means their anagen period will be slower and somewhat shorter than others.&nbsp;</span></p><p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0)">Whereas, a disturbance in hormone balance will reflect in hair fall. For example, elevated levels of testosterone (male hormone) can shorten the anagen phase, leading to thin hair and hair loss. Similarly, excess thyroid hormone (hypothyroidism) and insufficient thyroid hormone (hyperthyroidism) cause hair fall.</span></p><h2><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0)">Ways to Enhance hair growth</span></h2><p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0)">Though there are unavoidable causes like genetics and hormonal imbalance, a change in certain manageable factors such as lifestyle will activate hair growth and hence outgrow healthy hair.</span></p><p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0)">Improving these lifestyle activities will help nurture your hair and maintain your hair health in all four stages.</span></p><h3><span style="color: rgb(67, 67, 67)">Proper Nutrition</span></h3><h4><span style="color: rgb(102, 102, 102)">Eat Protein-rich foods</span></h4><p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0)">A sound body has a sound soul.

Various professions persuade people to sacrifice their sleep—which is unhealthy. If this relates to you, do not postpone the sleep to the next day or have it irregularly. Lack of sleep will damage brain cells, resulting in poor scalp blood circulation and inducing stress. Sleeping helps repair the damaged cells that develop while you are awake.&nbsp;</span></p><p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0)">During sleep, the body regulates and produces several hormones necessary for hair health. For instance, melatonin (sleep hormone) helps prolong the anagen (growth) phase of the hair cycle, potentially leading to longer and thicker hair. The melatonin release is insufficient during blue light exposure. Almost every screen gadget you use emits this blue light. So, keep phones, tablets, and laptops away from you at least 2 hours before bed.</span></p><p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0)">If you think 8 hours of sleep is sufficient, at any given time. You might be wrong because the melatonin release takes place only between 10 pm to 5 am. Daytime sleeping might not help in adequate melatonin secretion.</span></p><h3><span style="color: rgb(67, 67, 67)">Stress Management</span></h3><p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0)">The Mayo Clinic states three major premature hair loss because of high stress levels. They are</span></p><ul class="list-disc list-outside leading-3 -mt-2"><li class="leading-normal -mb-2"><p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0)"><strong>Telogen effluvium</strong> - this condition drives your hair to surpass from anagen phase to telogen, then into the exogen phase, multiplying the hair loss.</span></p></li><li class="leading-normal -mb-2"><p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0)"><strong>Trichotillomania</strong> - this rare disorder creates an irresistible urge to pull off the hair from the scalp, eyebrows and eyelashes</span></p></li><li class="leading-normal -mb-2"><p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0)"><strong>Alopecia areata</strong> - this condition is where your body attacks its own—including hair follicles, which results in hair fall.</span></p></li></ul><p></p><p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0)">On the other hand, stress affects hormonal balance. Under stressful circumstances, the body releases cortisol (the stress hormone). High cortisol levels can push more hair towards the telogen phase, leading to premature hair fall, hair thinning and hair shedding.&nbsp;</span></p><p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0)">If you cannot avoid stressful situations, manage them by doing simple practices such as yoga, meditation, breathing techniques, and performing your favourite hobbies.</span></p><p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0)">We are actively writing articles on the haircare series.

      title: "How Stress Affects Your Hair and What You Should Do",
      content:
        '<p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0)">One of the most common causes of hair loss is stress. Though everyone knows that it is a primal enemy, no one can avoid it. The world forces people to live with stress. Coming from office workers to sweepers, stress has been one common danger for all. Even you and I are experiencing the stress pumps right now, which result in hair fall. For people like us, it has become a necessity to balance work life, aka stress, and personal health. Today let’s look at how stress affects your hair and preventive and handling measures you can take.</span></p><h1><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0)">How Stress Affects Your Hair?</span></h1><p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0)">When we experience stress, our bodies react in various ways; this includes hair. To understand this connection, we must look at the science behind it.</span></p><h2><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0)">The Science Behind Stress and Hair Loss</span></h2><p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0)">If you are a biology student, you might have come across the word "cortisol," aka "stress hormone". Our body releases cortisol in stressful conditions. This hormone prepares our body for the fight-or-flight response. It induces immediate action. But if your stress stays high too long, the cortisol could weaken your hair follicles.</span></p><p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0)">Our body becomes hyperactive under stressful situations when managing a given circumstance or defending ourselves. The pupil dilates, we sweat a lot, and our hands shiver. We call this a fight-or-flight response. But the thing is, only vital body parts engage to fuel fight-or-flight reactions. Other non-essential functions, like hair growth, stay behind. This cycle harms the hair life cycle and causes hairs to shed early.</span></p><h2><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0)">Types of hair loss linked to stress.</span></h2><p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0)">Stress triggers distinct forms of hair loss in certain individuals. Understanding which one you are dealing with can help you find the right solution.</span></p><h3><span style="color: rgb(67, 67, 67)">Telogen Effluvium</span></h3><p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0)">This is one of the most common stress-related hair loss conditions. When you stress a lot, your body can push more hairs into the "telogen" phase. This is the resting phase of the hair growth cycle. After a couple of months, you may notice a significant increase in hair shedding.</span></p><h3><span style="color: rgb(67, 67, 67)">Alopecia Areata</span></h3><p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0)">Extreme stress can trigger this autoimmune condition. Your immune system starts attacking your hair follicles, leading to patchy hair loss. Managing stress levels often results in the regrowth of hair.</span></p><h3><span style="color: rgb(67, 67, 67)">Trichotillomania</span></h3><p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0)">This is a psychological condition where stress causes you to feel the urge to pull out your hair. It helps some people cope with intense stress. But, it can cause noticeable hair thinning or bald patches.</span></p><h2><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0)">How stress impacts the hair growth cycle</span></h2><p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0)">Your hair has three stages: anagen, catagen, and telogen. Anagen is the growth phase. Catagen is the transitional phase. Telogen is the resting phase. Stress affects the hair life cycle. This disruption shifts more hairs to enter the telogen phase. Only 10-15% of hairs are in the telogen phase at any given time. But stress can push 70% of your hair into the resting phase. You may notice an alarming amount of hair loss as a result.</span></p><h2><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0)">Signs That Stress Is Affecting Your Hair</span></h2><p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0)">It’s one thing to feel stressed, but how do you know if it’s actually impacting your hair? Here are some telltale signs.</span></p><h3><span style="color: rgb(67, 67, 67)">Hair shedding increases.</span></h3><p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0)">You might notice an uptick in the amount of hair left in your brush, on your pillow, or in the shower. This could be a sign of telogen effluvium. It causes stress to shed more hairs than normal.</span></p><h3><span style="color: rgb(67, 67, 67)">Patchy hair loss</span></h3><p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0)">If you see circular bald patches or uneven thinning, you may have alopecia areata. It\'s often linked to stress.</span></p><h3><span style="color: rgb(67, 67, 67)">Thinning Hair</span></h3><p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0)">Though not having large hair loss patches. Stress can cause gradual thinning. This makes your hair appear less voluminous over time.</span></p><h3><span style="color: rgb(67, 67, 67)">Changes in Hair Texture</span></h3><p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0)"><strong><br></strong>Stress can also alter the texture of your hair. It may become more brittle, dull, or lose its natural bounce due to the strain your body is under.</span></p><h3><span style="color: rgb(67, 67, 67)">The Emotional Toll of Stress-Related Hair Loss</span></h3><p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0)">Hair loss, especially from stress, harms more than your looks. It can also cause great emotional pain.</span></p><h3><span style="color: rgb(67, 67, 67)">Confidence and self-esteem issues</span></h3><p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0)">Hair is a big part of how we present ourselves to the world. Losing hair can hurt your confidence. It\'s tough when you see thinning or bald spots.</span></p><h3><span style="color: rgb(67, 67, 67)">Anxiety and worsening stress levels.</span></h3><p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0)">The irony of stress-related hair loss is this: the more hair you lose, the more stressed you become. It creates a vicious cycle. Worrying about your looks can increase stress. This may cause more hair loss.</span></p><h2><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0)">What You Can Do About Stress-Related Hair Loss</span></h2><p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0)">Don\'t worry if you see these signs. You can take steps to control stress and its hair damage effects.</span></p><h3><span style="color: rgb(67, 67, 67)">Manage Your Stress Levels</span></h3><h4><span style="color: rgb(102, 102, 102)">Practice mindfulness and Meditation.</span></h4><p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0)">The more calmer you stay, the more your hair will grow. To keep yourself calm, try mindfulness practices. This includes meditation, deep breathing exercises, and yoga. The fact is that these practices help reduce stress levels. In turn, they help protect your hair from extensive loss.</span></p><h4><span style="color: rgb(102, 102, 102)">Regular Physical Activity</span></h4><p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0)">Often our mentors tell us to exercise at least 2 times per week. This is because exercise is a proven stress buster that helps release an alternative hormone to cortisol called endorphins. The endorphin release helps balance cortisol levels and improve well-being.</span></p><h4><span style="color: rgb(102, 102, 102)">Adequate Sleep and Relaxation Techniques</span></h4><p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0)">Sleep is an underrated medicine that most of us avoid to put ourselves forward. Quality sleep is necessary for stress management. Studies say no one can sustain themselves without sleep for more than 11 days. If done, they will be dead. This particular fact proves how important sleep is, not food, and not even water.</span></p><p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0)">Always have a bedtime routine and limit screen time. Also, try relaxation techniques. Read or listen to calming music before bed.</span></p><h3><span style="color: rgb(67, 67, 67)">Improve your diet.</span></h3><p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0)">A healthy diet can do wonders for your hair. Eat protein-rich foods like eggs, nuts, and lean meats. Also, eat leafy greens high in vitamins, like iron and zinc. They are essential for healthy hair growth.</span></p><p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0)">Watch for nutritional deficiencies. Iron and vitamin D deficiencies are common in stressed people. A blood test can reveal whether you are lacking in these areas, and supplements can be a great help.</span></p><h4><span style="color: rgb(102, 102, 102)">Hair Care Practices to Protect Your Hair</span></h4><p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0)">Avoid Harsh Treatments and Over-styling. This may add extra pull to the hair strands, which results in unnecessary hair fall. Limit the use of heat tools, chemicals, and tight hairstyles. They can stress your hair even more.</span></p><p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0)">Use gentle shampoos and conditioners. They should nourish, not strip, your hair. Look for ingredients like biotin and keratin to strengthen your strands.</span></p><h4><span style="color: rgb(102, 102, 102)">Professional Treatments for Stress-Related Hair Loss</span></h4><p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0)">Not everyone has the same stress intensity. Some may need extra medications. Have dermatologist consultations. A visit to a dermatologist can diagnose your hair loss. They can also suggest targeted treatments.</span></p><p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0)">Hair Growth Treatments (Minoxidil, PRP Therapy) OTC treatments like Minoxidil (Rogaine) can help grow hair. PRP therapy is another option. It involves injecting your own platelets into the scalp to promote hair regrowth.</span></p><h2><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0)">When to Seek Help for Hair Loss</span></h2><p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0)">If your hair loss persists or worsens, it might be time to seek professional advice. Look for a dermatologist under these signs.</span></p><h3><span style="color: rgb(67, 67, 67)">Chronic Hair Shedding and Patches</span></h3><p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0)">If you have chronic hair shedding or large bald patches, consult a doctor. It\'s important to rule out any underlying conditions. Don\'t delay anymore.</span></p><h3><span style="color: rgb(67, 67, 67)">Emotional Distress Due to Hair Loss</span></h3><p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0)">Sometimes, we might have to wonder if the mere thought of hair fall affects mental health or if poor mental health leads to hair fall. There is an interconnection between both. If hair loss affects your mental health, seek help. A therapist or support group can help you cope.&nbsp;</span></p>',

      title: "How to grow a beard naturally?",
      content:
        '<p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0)">Everyone desires a well-groomed, neatly trimmed and sturdy beard. Unfortunately, only a few can grow successfully. The reason behind this might be many—from poor maintenance, and a half-plate diet to genetics—everyone has something.&nbsp;</span></p><p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0)">For grooming enthusiasts, it is easy to grow their beard with ease. They know what to do. But the question here is, what is the reason behind your beardless chin or lesser mane? Are you doing something that should not be done? Is it only genetics that play the beard part or something\'s left to improve?&nbsp;</span></p><p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0)">This blog discusses everything you need to know—from why you should have a beard to how to grow them naturally. Plus, we have also pulled topics like do’s and don’ts in beard grooming and, if beard supplements are necessary.</span></p><p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0)">Let\'s dive in.</span></p><h1><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0)">Why should I have a beard?</span></h1><p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0)">Wait a second, if it is true that not every face suits a beard look and some might appear better off beardless, why should I consider even maintaining it? What if I look better this way? You might ask.</span></p><p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0)">Yes, you pitched right buddy. Not everyone with a long beard is hot and men without a beard are average. It depends on the facial structure. Let us discuss that later. For now, the reason behind why one should have a beard has few scientific answers.</span></p><h3><span style="color: rgb(67, 67, 67)">Power up the Masculinity&nbsp;</span></h3><p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0)">Number one “Beard is the symbol of Masculinity” there is scientific evidence that girls actually find guys more masculine with beards. Hold on, it is not the opposite for those who don\'t have, but yes, women find those guys very attractive.&nbsp;</span></p><p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0)">This is probably because of the link between beard and testosterone. High testosterone equals a long and healthy beard. Biology speaks!</span></p><p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0)">Look, we get you are not to impress anyone. What if I say that wearing a beard can actually make you look younger and slimmer?</span></p><h3><span style="color: rgb(67, 67, 67)">Elevate your Facial Structure&nbsp;</span></h3><p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0)">You may have witnessed people\'s faces once looked slimmer and now appear a bit puffy without it. This is just the beard that acts as your face fat natural coverage, igniting a slim look by improving the jawline appearance.</span></p><p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0)">Moreover, you can mask those ugly wrinkles that reside on your face. It is just like wearing an overcoat upon a thinner shirt — the layering effect — nobody cares what\'s inside, people just scan the outside look.</span></p><p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0)">&nbsp;Now, we understand the importance of having a beard to increase our overall look. Are there some health benefits to maintaining a beard? The answer is “yes”.</span></p><h3><span style="color: rgb(67, 67, 67)">Protects your Chin in the Winter</span></h3><p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0)">We are just like any other mammal or animal. A close relative of chimpanzees and bonobos, right? The very reason animals have a lot of fur on the first hand is to protect themselves under harsh weather—Cold or hot—a polar bear will die out of shivering in winter if it were a hairless creature and a camel in the desert.</span></p><p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0)">Similarly, humans, having developed from monkeys, have had fur once. It just vanished over the years. The man has to play a major part in heavy labour work (remember; we were hunters and gatherers at one point). Hence, the skin demands protection under extreme weather. This is one of the possible reasons why men have beards while women do not. Again, a biological explanation.&nbsp;</span></p><h3><span style="color: rgb(67, 67, 67)">Boosts up your confidence&nbsp;</span></h3><p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0)">The fourth reason you should consider having a beard is it can level up your confidence among other men. Just feel the alpha male vibes! Certain studies claim that a beard helps out having real one-on-one connections with other men.&nbsp;</span></p><p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0)">A lot of men recognised for Braveheart actually had a long-grown beard—especially in Asian countries, including India. Men used to show their potential through a full beard look.</span></p><p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0)">It was natural. It is natural.&nbsp;</span></p><h3><span style="color: rgb(67, 67, 67)">Outperform you Look</span></h3><p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0)">A man named Lupin disguised himself as escaping from the police just by altering his beard shapes, and moustache and, with the help of some additional accessories.&nbsp;</span></p><p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0)">Though it is a fictional character, the point here is true. Change your beard and change others\' perspective on you. It is like being born every time with a new version of yourself. The bad guy looks and the good guy looks – Beard is a game changer!</span></p><p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0)">Before getting into the real subject, we want you to know the factors that stop the beard from growing – things which are out of your hands.</span></p><h2><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0)">Causes of no Beard growth</span></h2><p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0)">To keep it short, we have stated a few possible causes why your beard does not grow. You should consider these, and see whether you are doing it or think of having it.</span><br></p><ul class="list-disc list-outside leading-3 -mt-2"><li class="leading-normal -mb-2"><p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0)">Poor diet</span></p></li><li class="leading-normal -mb-2"><p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0)">Genetics</span></p></li><li class="leading-normal -mb-2"><p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0)">Stress</span></p></li><li class="leading-normal -mb-2"><p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0)">Alopecia&nbsp;</span></p></li><li class="leading-normal -mb-2"><p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0)">Low testosterone&nbsp;</span></p></li></ul><p><br><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0)">If you think these might be the reason for being beardless, it means you might be experiencing health concerns such as poor diet and stress, which is not a big part.</span></p><p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0)">But you should consult a doctor for factors like genetics, alopecia and low testosterone levels. We suggest you identify the cause first-hand and move to the solution. Skipping this process might lead to unfavourable outcomes.</span></p><h2><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0)">Proven Ways to Grow Your Beard Naturally</span></h2><h3><span style="color: rgb(67, 67, 67)">Proper Skin Care for Beard Growth</span></h3><p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0)">Believe it or not, healthy skin leads to a healthy beard. Taking care of your skin sets the foundation for strong facial hair growth. Here’s how you can maintain proper skin care to promote beard growth.</span></p><h4><span style="color: rgb(102, 102, 102)">Exfoliation and cleansing</span></h4><p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0)">Dead skin cells can clog your pores, preventing hair from growing as it should. Regularly exfoliating your face with a gentle scrub removes dirt and dead skin, ensuring your hair follicles are clear. Follow up with a facial cleanser to keep the skin fresh.</span></p><h4><span style="color: rgb(102, 102, 102)">Moisturising Your Face</span></h4><p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0)">A dry face is not favourable to beard growth. Keeping your skin moisturised encourages healthy follicles. Because our body contains up to 80% of water. Hence, hair too. Using a natural moisturiser or beard oil that contains essential oils like jojoba or argan oil can provide the hydration your skin needs while nourishing your beard hair.</span></p><h4><span style="color: rgb(102, 102, 102)">Benefits of Beard Oil</span></h4><p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0)">Beard oil is more than just a grooming product—it’s essential for growth. Beard oils contain ingredients that moisturise both the skin and the hair. Look for oils with ingredients like eucalyptus, argan, or jojoba oil for optimal results.</span></p><h3><span style="color: rgb(67, 67, 67)">A Balanced Diet for Healthy Beard Growth</span></h3><p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0)">What you eat affects more than just your waistline—it also affects your beard! A balanced diet rich in vitamins and minerals can help foster healthier and quicker beard growth.</span></p><h4><span style="color: rgb(102, 102, 102)">Protein-Rich Foods</span></h4><p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0)">Keratin is the protein that makes up hair. Eating protein-rich foods like chicken, eggs, and fish will give your body the building blocks it needs to produce more facial hair.</span></p><h4><span style="color: rgb(102, 102, 102)">Vitamins and Minerals Essential for Beard Growth</span></h4><h5><span style="color: rgb(102, 102, 102)">Vitamin D</span></h5><p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0)">This vitamin plays a crucial role in the development of hair follicles. Spending time in the sun or taking a vitamin D supplement could enhance beard growth.</span></p><h5><span style="color: rgb(102, 102, 102)">Vitamin B7 (Biotin)</span></h5><p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0)">Biotin is a common link to hair growth. It strengthens hair and nails, helping your beard grow thicker and healthier. Foods like nuts, seeds, and sweet potatoes are rich in biotin.</span></p><h5><span style="color: rgb(102, 102, 102)">Omega-3 Fatty Acids</span></h5><p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0)">These fatty acids help maintain healthy hair by nourishing the hair follicles. Foods like salmon, walnuts, and flaxseeds contain high levels of omega-3s.</span></p><h3><span style="color: rgb(67, 67, 67)">Importance of Exercise and Blood Circulation</span></h3><p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0)">Exercise is not only great for overall health but also for beard growth. It stimulates the production of testosterone, which is crucial for hair growth.</span></p><h4><span style="color: rgb(102, 102, 102)">How Exercise Boosts Testosterone</span></h4><p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0)">Strength training and high-intensity interval training (HIIT) are particularly good at boosting testosterone levels. The more testosterone your body produces, the better your chances of growing a thick beard.</span></p><h4><span style="color: rgb(102, 102, 102)">The Role of Blood Circulation in Beard Growth</span></h4><p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0)">Exercise also promotes better blood circulation. Good circulation ensures that nutrients get to your hair follicles more efficiently, helping your beard grow faster and healthier. You can also use the inverted yoga position to increase blood flow towards your head. But remember. Always have a companion to help you to do such poses.</span></p><h3><span style="color: rgb(67, 67, 67)">Sleep and Stress Management</span></h3><p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0)">Sleep and stress play a critical role in beard growth. When you\'re stressed or sleep-deprived, your body produces more cortisol, a hormone that hinders testosterone production.</span></p><h4><span style="color: rgb(102, 102, 102)">How Lack of Sleep Affects Beard Growth</span></h4><p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0)">Sleep is an essential mantra for hormone regulation. Aim for at least 7-8 hours of quality sleep per night to support natural beard growth. It is not that you can sleep at 2. a.m and wake up at 11. This routine is a poor sleep routine, as it can affect melatonin release. Well, what is melatonin? The hormone which regulates your sleep. Try an early sleep and makeup routine.&nbsp;</span></p><h4><span style="color: rgb(102, 102, 102)">Reducing Stress for Better Facial Hair</span></h4><p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0)">There is no one without stress. It has become a part of our life. Though it is unavoidable, a few stress management techniques like meditation, yoga, or simply taking time for yourself can help reduce cortisol (stress-causing hormone) levels. This promotes a better environment for beard growth.</span></p><h2><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0)">Avoid Shaving Myths</span></h2><p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0)">You’ve probably heard the old wives\' tale that shaving makes your beard grow faster and thicker. Unfortunately, this is just a myth. Shaving doesn\'t impact how fast your beard grows; it only gives the illusion of thickness because the hair starts off blunt.</span></p><h3><span style="color: rgb(67, 67, 67)">Natural Home Remedies for Beard Growth</span></h3><p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0)">Similar to how certain ingredients help your hair grow faster, several natural ingredients can help stimulate beard growth. Here are a few remedies you can try at home:</span></p><h4><span style="color: rgb(102, 102, 102)">Coconut Oil for Beard Growth</span></h4><p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0)">People know coconut oil for its moisturizing properties and its ability to penetrate hair follicles, which promotes stronger and healthier hair.</span></p><h4><span style="color: rgb(102, 102, 102)">Amla Oil</span></h4><p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0)">Amla oil, made from Indian gooseberries, is rich in vitamin C and antioxidants, which boost collagen production and beard growth.</span></p><h4><span style="color: rgb(102, 102, 102)">Aloe Vera Gel</span></h4><p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0)">Aloe vera is soothing to the skin and promotes the growth of healthy facial hair by keeping your skin hydrated and irritation-free.</span></p><h4><span style="color: rgb(102, 102, 102)">Eucalyptus Oil</span></h4><p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0)">Eucalyptus oil can help stimulate beard growth by improving blood circulation around the hair follicles.</span></p><h2><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0)">Beard Growth Supplements</span></h2><p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0)">If you feel like your beard isn’t growing fast enough, you might consider taking supplements. But taking supplements alone and leaving out other steps won’t help your beard growth. Supplement is something like additional support for a desirable outcome.</span></p><h3><span style="color: rgb(67, 67, 67)">Are Supplements Necessary?</span></h3><p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0)">While you can get most of the necessary nutrients from a balanced diet, some people choose to use supplements to boost their vitamin intake. As we said, taking supplements provides fast results.</span></p><h3><span style="color: rgb(67, 67, 67)">Popular Beard Growth Supplements</span></h3><p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0)">There are a variety of beard supplements claiming to be the best. Biotin, vitamin D, and fish oil supplements are common choices for those looking to enhance their beard growth.</span></p><h2><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0)">Consistency and Patience in Beard Growth</span></h2><p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0)">Growing a beard takes time, and consistency is key. Stick to your skincare, diet, and grooming routine. Don’t expect overnight results—beard growth is a slow and steady process.</span></p><h3><span style="color: rgb(67, 67, 67)">The Importance of Sticking to a Routine</span></h3><p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0)">A well-established routine ensures that your beard receives the necessary care and nutrients it needs to grow healthily.</span></p><h2><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0)">How Long Does It Take to See Results?</span></h2><p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0)">You might ask us, how long does it take the beard to grow? Well, typically, it takes about 2-6 months for most men to see significant beard growth, depending on genetics and lifestyle.</span></p><h3><span style="color: rgb(67, 67, 67)">Grooming and Trimming: Do’s and Don’ts</span></h3><p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0)">While it might seem offbeat, trimming your beard regularly can actually help it grow stronger and healthier.</span></p><h4><span style="color: rgb(102, 102, 102)">Why does Trimming Help Beard Growth?</span></h4><p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0)">Just like why we go to the barbershop. trimming gets rid of split ends and uneven patches, which can make your beard appear fuller. It is equally important to trim for once at a period gap of 15 days. Daily trimming is not recommended.</span></p><h4><span style="color: rgb(102, 102, 102)">Choosing the Right Beard Shape</span></h4><p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0)">Groom your beard according to your face shape to enhance its appearance and your overall look. Some have oval shapes whereas some possess square faces. Identify your facial structure and style your beard accordingly.</span></p><h2><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0)">Managing Patchy Beard Growth</span></h2><p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0)">Okay, now you have the solutions. But what about those current patches you struggling to hide right now? Don’t worry! Here are some tips to manage it:</span></p><p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0)">Brush your beard daily to encourage hair growth in patchy areas. You can also try using castor oil, which has been known to promote hair growth. Certain beard fillers are coming on the market. Either you could buy it or have a natural beard look by DIY Henna Beard Pack.</span></p><h3><span style="color: rgb(67, 67, 67)">Love Your Natural Beard</span></h3><p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0)">Sometimes, loving the natural look of your beard is the best approach. You are unique, so your beard is. Work with what you’ve got and wear it with confidence!</span></p><h3><span style="color: rgb(67, 67, 67)">Hydration: Drink Plenty of Water</span></h3><p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0)">Lastly, don’t forget to hydrate. Drinking enough water helps maintain healthy skin and hair follicles, which are essential for beard growth.</span></p><p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0)">Growing a beard naturally requires patience, proper care, and a balanced lifestyle.

      title: "5 Proven Remedies for Dandruff Relief",
      content:
        '<p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0)">Dandruff. We’ve all experienced it at some point—those pesky white flakes on our shoulders and an itchy scalp. It’s annoying, embarrassing, and can really affect your confidence. But the good news is that dandruff is manageable, and with the right remedies, you can bring it under control. In this blog, we’ll dive into five proven remedies for dandruff relief that you can try at home.</span></p><h2><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0)">What is Dandruff?</span></h2><p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0)">Dandruff is a common scalp condition that causes flaky skin to appear, often accompanied by itching. These flakes are dead skin cells that are shed from the scalp, and while it\'s not harmful or contagious, it can lead to persistent hair fall and sometimes frustrating.</span></p><h2><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0)">Few Common Cause of Dandruff</span></h2><p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0)">Several factors can contribute to dandruff, and knowing the root cause can help in treating it effectively.</span></p><h3><span style="color: rgb(67, 67, 67)">Dry Skin:</span></h3><p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0)">One of the most common causes of dandruff is simple dry skin. During winter months or in dry climates, the skin on the scalp can become parched and start flaking off.</span></p><h3><span style="color: rgb(67, 67, 67)">Seborrheic Dermatitis:&nbsp;</span></h3><p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0)">This skin condition results in oily, red, and scaly skin, especially in areas rich in oil glands. When it affects the scalp, it leads to dandruff.

      title: "Epsom Salt for hair: Benefits and guidelines.",
      content:
        '<p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0)">Epsom salt might be a new term you are hearing for the first time. Also known as magnesium sulphate, Epsom salt has recently been booming for doing wonders to hair. Whether you have itching, excess oils or scalp buildup, this affordable mineral compound is a go-sure solution to transform the hair into a clean and luscious one. This blog discusses the benefits of Epsom salt, the directions to use it and many more.&nbsp;</span></p><h1><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0)">Ultimate Benefits of Epsom Salt</span></h1><p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0)">Proven for its therapeutic properties, Epsom salt has been a popular ingredient people have used since ancient days. Though it has missed its popularity for some decades, it has been widespread lately. Epsom salt offers you a range of benefits necessary for healthy hair. Here is a brief account of its advantages.</span></p><h3><span style="color: rgb(67, 67, 67)">Cleansing Nature</span></h3><p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0)">Epsom salt works as a great scalp exfoliant, like how salicylic acid acts for skin exfoliation. This inorganic mineral compound is efficient in removing excess scalp builds, dead skin, and excess oil. Trichologists (hair specialists) suggest their clients remove extra product build-ups weekly once. This habit promotes a healthy scalp, creating space for sound hair growth.</span></p><h3><span style="color: rgb(67, 67, 67)">Stimulates Blood Circulation</span></h3><p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0)">Ayurveda says performing Shiro Abhyanga (scalp massage) every day will help achieve strong and lustrous hair. Considering this fact, Epsom salt can be said as a natural blood circulation stimulator at a metaphoric level. The primary molecule of Epsom salt, magnesium triggers blood circulation when applied to the scalp. Better circulation in turn contributes to maximising nutrient absorption, eventually facilitating the growth of beautiful locks.</span></p><h3><span style="color: rgb(67, 67, 67)">Relieves Scalp Itching</span></h3><p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0)">Almost ten among fifteen people have dandruff, itching and flaky scalp problems. Epsom salt can get rid of this with its few uses. Its inflammatory properties soothe irritated skin, and its exfoliation process removes and sets a dandruff-free scalp.</span></p><h3><span style="color: rgb(67, 67, 67)">Increase Hair Volume and Texture</span></h3><p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0)">If you are looking for a natural hair volume booster, Epsom salt is all you need. Unlike other toxic hair volumizers, this magical component contains only two simple chemicals—magnesium and sulphur—which are not harmful at all. Epsom salt can give your hair a natural boost by increasing volume and texture. You can use this with hair masks or rinses to lift the roots and achieve a fuller hair appearance.</span></p><h3><span style="color: rgb(67, 67, 67)">Regulates Oil Production</span></h3><p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0)">We are not strangers to oily scalps—every one of us has experienced them once and might still be. However, Epsom salt helps you retain your clean scalp fast, besides using oil-regulating products. The molecules of Epsom salt bind with oil, reducing the overall oiliness and maintaining a balanced scalp environment. This simple mechanism creates an illusion of dry hair without compromising the scalp’s health.</span></p><h2><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0)">How to Use Epsom Salt for Hair</span></h2><p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0)">People began using this super-affordable yet effective compound after learning its benefits. You can get Epsom salt in a nearby store or buy it online. There are multiple ways of using this in your hair care routine, such as following the steps below.</span></p><h3><span style="color: rgb(67, 67, 67)">Along with shampoo</span></h3><p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0)">One way of using Epsom salt is by combining it with a mild shampoo. Mix a small amount of Epsom salt in the shampoo, dilute it in the water and use as usual. It is claimed that washing Epsom salt-infused shampoo is effective when used twice. Hence, use two times if you have an oily scalp.</span></p><h3><span style="color: rgb(67, 67, 67)">Use with a hair mask</span></h3><p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0)">Add this with natural hair ingredients like aloe vera, coconut oil or any other water-consistent organic ingredient.</span></p><h4><span style="color: rgb(102, 102, 102)">Step 1</span></h4><p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0)">Combine 1 tablespoon of Epsom salt with 1/2 cup of coconut or olive oil.</span></p><h4><span style="color: rgb(102, 102, 102)">Step 2</span></h4><p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0)">Focus on the roots of your hair when applying the mixture to your scalp.</span></p><h4><span style="color: rgb(102, 102, 102)">Step 3</span></h4><p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0)">Let it sit for 15-20 minutes to let the minerals fully absorb.</span></p><h4><span style="color: rgb(102, 102, 102)">Step 4</span></h4><p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0)">Rinse out thoroughly and follow with your regular shampoo and conditioner.</span></p><h3><span style="color: rgb(67, 67, 67)">Scalp Massage&nbsp;</span></h3><p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0)">Add a small amount of Epsom salt with water, dilute it and apply on the damp hair. Massage gently for 10 - 15 minutes, let it sit for another five minutes and wash off immediately. This process promotes better scalp blood circulation and stimulates hair growth by removing dead skin.</span></p><h3><span style="color: rgb(67, 67, 67)">As a Hair Volumizer</span></h3><p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0)">Add Epsom salt with water in a spray bottle and mist it onto damp hair for a quick volume boost. Scrunch your hair with your fingers while blow-drying to add texture and create natural-looking waves.</span></p><p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0)">Mix Epsom salt with your favourite styling product, such as mousse or gel, and apply to your hair\'s roots. To add volume, lift the hair at the roots with your fingers or a comb. Blow-dry your hair upside down for extra lift.</span></p><h2><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0)">What should you know about Epsom salt?</span></h2><p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0)">Epsom salt can be one of the best ways to remove dandruff, itchiness and excess oil when used effectively. The cleansing mechanism of Epsom salt differs according to hair type.&nbsp;</span></p><h4><span style="color: rgb(102, 102, 102)">For Dry Hair</span></h4><p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0)">Epsom salt is a highly sustainable cleanser and an exfoliator. For dry hair, the frequent use of Epsom salt might result in frizzy, brittle and damaged hair. Using once per week is suggestible under this scenario.</span></p><h4><span style="color: rgb(102, 102, 102)">For Oily Hair</span></h4><p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0)">Unlike dry hair, Epsom salt does wonders for oily hair by binding to oil particles, leaving out a clean and clear scalp. Use weekly twice for best results.&nbsp;</span></p><h3><span style="color: rgb(67, 67, 67)">Important Things to Remember</span></h3><h4><span style="color: rgb(102, 102, 102)">Patch test:&nbsp;</span></h4><p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0)">Do a patch test before you use it. Dilute Epsom salt with water, apply it on the back of your neck and leave it overnight. Avoid using it if the patch gets worse.&nbsp;</span></p><h4><span style="color: rgb(102, 102, 102)">Overuse:</span></h4><p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0)">Do not overuse Epsom salt. Frequent use of Epsom salt may trigger hair at a point and this advice is applicable for all hair types. It may trigger at some point for any type of hair if used very often. Just use it at a balanced pace.</span></p><h4><span style="color: rgb(102, 102, 102)">Sensitive Scalp:</span></h4><p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0)">We do not advise you to use this if you have a sensitive scalp. It may not give positive results all the time. It might induce a negative impact but very rarely—especially for sensitive scalps.</span></p>',
